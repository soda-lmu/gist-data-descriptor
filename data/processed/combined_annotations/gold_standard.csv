03.1.2 Our climate footprint 
Allianz’s Group Climate Change Strategy 
commits us to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 across our business in line with the 1.5°C pathway. This is translated into dedicated strategies and targets across our value chain emissions: Our business operations (scope 1, 2 and most material scope 3 emissions), our proprietary investments (scope 3 category 15 ‘financed emissions’), as well as our insurance underwriting (scope 3 category 15 ‘insurance-associated emissions’)

For insurance-associated emissions the 
methodology is curr
ently been jointly 
developed by the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance and Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials. 
Proprietary investment portfolio 
carbon footprint 
Both our listed equity and corporate 
bonds portfolios have undergone considerable changes in the past three years, characterized by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,  the war in Ukraine, and the  first impacts of our portfolio steering towards the climate targets. Since 2019, we achieved a reduction of absolute emissions by 
-35 % and 
are below our target of -25 % for 2024. 
Portfolio reallocations contributed -26 %p, overarchingly driven by intra-sector shifts to lower-emitting companies (i.e., inside utilities and manufacturing sector). Real world emission reductions by investee companies contributed -6 %p; the remaining effects can be attributed to a change in the denominator (EVIC). This shows that stronger short-term actions by investee companies on  emission reductions are necessary. 
In 2022, we added carbon footprint figures f
or parts of our real estate portfolio 
(direct and joint ventures), for our direct infrastructure equity portfolio (without co-investments) and for our sovereign portfolio, in total now covering 59.6 % of our investment portfolio. For further details about targets for infrastructure equity (direct) and real estate (direct/ JV), please refer to section 02.2.2. Allianz is working with the A
OA to finalize 
the methods for sovereign bonds as next asset class. We will set targets for this asset class within 12 months after the recommended methodology is released  by the AOA. Due to scope

03.1 The global challenge and the role of Allianz
03.1.2 Our climate footprint 
Allianz’s Group Climate Change Strategy 
commits us to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 across our business in line with the 1.5°C pathway. This is translated into dedicated strategies and targets across our value chain emissions: Our business operations (scope 1, 2 and most material scope 3 emissions), our proprietary investments (scope 3 category 15 ‘financed emissions’), as well as our insurance underwriting (scope 3 category 15 ‘insurance-associated emissions’)
1, for our business operations 
is even by 2030. 
For insurance-associated emissions the 
methodology is curr
ently been jointly 
developed by the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance and Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials. 
Proprietary investment portfolio 
carbon footprint 
Both our listed equity and corporate 
bonds portfolios have undergone considerable changes in the past three years, characterized by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,  the war in Ukraine, and the  first impacts of our portfolio steering towards the climate targets. Since 2019, we achieved a reduction of absolute emissions by 
-35 % and 
are below our target of -25 % for 2024. 
Portfolio reallocations contributed -26 %p, overarchingly driven by intra-sector shifts to lower-emitting companies (i.e., inside utilities and manufacturing sector). Real world emission reductions by investee companies contributed -6 %p; the remaining effects can be attributed to a change in the denominator (EVIC). This shows that stronger short-term actions by investee companies on  emission reductions are necessary. 
In 2022, we added carbon footprint figures f
or parts of our real estate portfolio 
(direct and joint ventures), for our direct infrastructure equity portfolio (without co-investments) and for our sovereign portfolio, in total now covering 59.6 % of our investment portfolio. For further details about targets for infrastructure equity (direct) and real estate (direct/ JV), please refer to section 02.2.2. Allianz is working with the A
OA to finalize 
the methods for sovereign bonds as next asset class. We will set targets for this asset class within 12 months after the recommended methodology is released  by the AOA. Due to scope

03.1.2 Our climate footprint 
Allianz’s Group Climate Change Strategy 
commits us to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 across our business in line with the 1.5°C pathway. This is translated into dedicated strategies and targets across our value chain emissions: Our business operations (scope 1, 2 and most material scope 3 emissions), our proprietary investments (scope 3 category 15 ‘financed emissions’), as well as our insurance underwriting (scope 3 category 15 ‘insurance-associated emissions’)

For insurance-associated emissions the 
methodology is curr
ently been jointly 
developed by the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance and Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials. 
Proprietary investment portfolio 
carbon footprint 
Both our listed equity and corporate 
bonds portfolios have undergone considerable changes in the past three years, characterized by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,  the war in Ukraine, and the  first impacts of our portfolio steering towards the climate targets. Since 2019, we achieved a reduction of absolute emissions by 
-35 % and 
are below our target of -25 % for 2024. 
Portfolio reallocations contributed -26 %p, overarchingly driven by intra-sector shifts to lower-emitting companies (i.e., inside utilities and manufacturing sector). Real world emission reductions by investee companies contributed -6 %p; the remaining effects can be attributed to a change in the denominator (EVIC). This shows that stronger short-term actions by investee companies on  emission reductions are necessary. 
In 2022, we added carbon footprint figures f
or parts of our real estate portfolio 
(direct and joint ventures), for our direct infrastructure equity portfolio (without co-investments) and for our sovereign portfolio, in total now covering 59.6 % of our investment portfolio. For further details about targets for infrastructure equity (direct) and real estate (direct/ JV), please refer to section 02.2.2. Allianz is working with the A

the methods for sovereign bonds as next asset class. We will set targets for this asset class within 12 months after the recommended methodology is released  by the AOA. Due to scope

03.1 The global challenge and the role of Allianz
03.1.2 Our climate footprint 
Allianz’s Group Climate Change Strategy 
commits us to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 across our business in line with the 1.5°C pathway. This is translated into dedicated strategies and targets across our value chain emissions: Our business operations (scope 1, 2 and most material scope 3 emissions), our proprietary investments (scope 3 category 15 ‘financed emissions’), as well as our insurance underwriting (scope 3 category 15 ‘insurance-associated emissions’)
1, for our business operations 
is even by 2030. 
For insurance-associated emissions the 
methodology is curr
ently been jointly 
developed by the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance and Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials. 
Proprietary investment portfolio 
carbon footprint 
Both our listed equity and corporate 
bonds portfolios have undergone considerable changes in the past three years, characterized by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,  the war in Ukraine, and the  first impacts of our portfolio steering towards the climate targets. Since 2019, we achieved a reduction of absolute emissions by 
-35 % and 
are below our target of -25 % for 2024. 
Portfolio reallocations contributed -26 %p, overarchingly driven by intra-sector shifts to lower-emitting companies (i.e., inside utilities and manufacturing sector). Real world emission reductions by investee companies contributed -6 %p; the remaining effects can be attributed to a change in the denominator (EVIC). This shows that stronger short-term actions by investee companies on  emission reductions are necessary. 
In 2022, we added carbon footprint figures f
or parts of our real estate portfolio 
(direct and joint ventures), for our direct infrastructure equity portfolio (without co-investments) and for our sovereign portfolio, in total now covering 59.6 % of our investment portfolio. For further details about targets for infrastructure equity (direct) and real estate (direct/ JV), please refer to section 02.2.2. Allianz is working with the A
OA to finalize 
the methods for sovereign bonds as next asset class. We will set targets for this asset class within 12 months after the recommended methodology is released  by the AOA. Due to scope

CO2e emissions in absolute figures and in relation to revenues  
In total, we emitted 2,031.08 tonnes of CO2 equivalents in 2020 (2019: 4,215.37 
tonnes), which corresponds to a reduction of almost 52 percent. Emissions  comprise 
Scope 1 emissions of 322.84 tonnes (2019: 170.8 tonnes), Scope 2  emissions of 
398.14 tonnes (2019: 406.6 tonnes), and Scope 3 emissions of 1,310.1 tonnes 
(2019: 3,637.97 tonnes) (cf. chart on page 49).
In relation to revenues at AIXTRON SE, emissions fell to 7.54 tonnes per EUR 1 
million of revenues (2019: 16.24 tonnes/EUR 1 million). 
This reduction is due to the measures taken by the government and resultant 
restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic, which were reflected 
in substantially reduced travel activities by our employees. This factor offset the 
slight increase in Scope 1 emissions.

Fight against climate change
During 2021, we have analysed all 
of our sites to calculate our carbon 
footprint, since this is one of our 
commitments in terms of the fight against climate change. 
For some of the sites, we have not been 
able to calculate emissions resulting from electricity consumption, since this 
is included in rental costs. Nevertheless, 
the carbon footprint calculation includes the energy consumption of most of the major Allfunds sites by number of employees, and we wish to certify our carbon footprint as further proof of our 
transparency and expertise.
The result of the 2021 carbon footprint 
calculation for all our sites is as follows:Scope 1 corresponds to direct emissions. 
These include:
 ›Fuel consumption in buildings from 
natural gas or oil-fired boiler activity. No fuel is consumed in any of our sites.
 ›Emissions due to refrigerant gas leaks in refrigeration and air conditioning 
equipment. There has only been 
one refrigerant gas leak in the site in London, with a recharge of 3.5 kg of R-410A gas. 
 ›Vehicle fuel consumption. Vehicles owned by Allfunds are leased and are a social benefit that the company makes available to its employees. The vehicle is for own use and is therefore not taken into account to calculate our 
carbon footprint.
Scope 2 is indirect emissions due to 
electricity consumption in buildings.
The energy intensity ratio of the GHG 
emissions of the organisation for 2021, for 
scopes 1 and 2, is 0.04 t  CO

Management of natural resources is a commercial and social imperative, as well as an environmental one. 
Efficient use of resources reduces costs; enabling nature corridors supports the health of our ecosystems;  
and responsible management can help us to more effectively engage our people, customers and communities.  
Key statistics/  
achievements −APRR GHG emission reduction of 1.4%* 
 −20% of electricity used in APRR is from renewable sources
 −Electric charging stations every 80 kilometres along APRR’s 2,318 kilometre network
 −APRR group ISO14001 certified for motorway operation activity
 *based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions, not including customer traffic emissions.
A motorway’s primary areas of environmental impact lie in 
road construction activities, in running and maintaining the 
road, and in customers’ use of the road. 
At Atlas Arteria, we aim to effectively manage and minimise 
associated impacts, with a particular focus on reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and protecting the natural 
environment.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Each of our portfolio roads proactively works on reducing its 
energy use and therefore its associated carbon footprint. For 
APRR specifically, management of GHG emission forms a key 
part of its ESG strategy, alongside a focus on safety.
Initiatives include: the installation of solar panels on 23 
buildings and structures at service stations to power operating 
equipment; solar hot water production present at 35 service 
areas; LED lighting widely deployed in motorway tunnels to 
reduce energy consumption; recycling of pavement materials; 
and reduced own-emissions through action on business travel, 
building use and server consumption.
APRR has analysed its energy use and GHG emissions since 
2011 and this year saw a reduction of 1.4% across its Scope 1 
and 2 emissions.

approach. Atlas Arteria holds a 31.14% interest in APRR. In accordance with  
this, data represents 31.14% of APRR’s calculated GHG emissions.
**  Scope 3 data presented here is limited to customer traffic emissions. Scope 1 
and 2 emissions are therefore more reflective of APRR’s own GHG emissions.At Warnow Tunnel, the toll plaza was completely refurbished 
with LED lights in 2019. This has contributed to a 3.8% reduction 
in energy use across the Warnow Tunnel business compared  
to 2018 (797,077 kWh in 2019 compared to 828,792kWh in 2018).
Customer emissions
As a road operator, one of the biggest impact areas lies in the 
carbon footprint associated with customers’ use of our roads. 
As climate change continues to grow on the global agenda, 
customers will increasingly make changes to living habits to 
minimise their own footprint. Our ability to enable customers  
to reduce their footprint is therefore a priority for us.
Compared to standard roads, the nature of motorways 
generally offers improved efficiencies: allowing for faster and 
more consistent driving speeds, reduced traffic congestion  
and improved travel time. These efficiencies should translate 
to reduced fuel consumption and emissions. 
In addition, we continue to seek options that proactively 
facilitate a reduced customer footprint. For example, electric 
charging stations are provided every 80 kilometres along 
APRR’s 2,318 kilometre network, enabling customers to 
transition to electric vehicles. An additional 16 very high power 
charging stations were added this year, providing further 
improvements to charge times (see case study on page 5). 
Carpooling is also encouraged, with 4,135 carparks now 
installed alongside APRR’s network in support of this. 
We keep abreast of new technology to ensure that we can 
provide a timely response to developing needs, for example  
in being prepared to support autonomous vehicles on our  
road networks. OUR SUSTAINABILITY PRIORITIES

buildings and structures at service stations to power operating 
equipment; solar hot water production present at 35 service 
areas; LED lighting widely deployed in motorway tunnels to 
reduce energy consumption; recycling of pavement materials; 
and reduced own-emissions through action on business travel, 
building use and server consumption.
APRR has analysed its energy use and GHG emissions since 
2011 and this year saw a reduction of 1.4% across its Scope 1

with LED lights in 2019. This has contributed to a 3.8% reduction 
in energy use across the Warnow Tunnel business compared  
to 2018 (797,077 kWh in 2019 compared to 828,792kWh in 2018).
Customer emissions
As a road operator, one of the biggest impact areas lies in the 
carbon footprint associated with customers’ use of our roads. 
As climate change continues to grow on the global agenda, 
customers will increasingly make changes to living habits to 
minimise their own footprint. Our ability to enable customers  
to reduce their footprint is therefore a priority for us.
Compared to standard roads, the nature of motorways 
generally offers improved efficiencies: allowing for faster and 
more consistent driving speeds, reduced traffic congestion  
and improved travel time. These efficiencies should translate 
to reduced fuel consumption and emissions. 
In addition, we continue to seek options that proactively 
facilitate a reduced customer footprint. For example, electric 
charging stations are provided every 80 kilometres along 
APRR’s 2,318 kilometre network, enabling customers to 
transition to electric vehicles. An additional 16 very high power 
charging stations were added this year, providing further 
improvements to charge times (see case study on page 5). 
Carpooling is also encouraged, with 4,135 carparks now 
installed alongside APRR’s network in support of this. 
We keep abreast of new technology to ensure that we can 
provide a timely response to developing needs, for example  
in being prepared to support autonomous vehicles on our  
road networks. OUR SUSTAINABILITY PRIORITIES

At Atlas Arteria, we aim to effectively manage and minimise 
associated impacts, with a particular focus on reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and protecting the natural

the average of the years 2019-2020-2021 (combined, including joint ventures).
The Scope 1 & 2 intensity ratios in kg CO2/ton were restated due to the changes in calculation methods applied and the extension of the reported disclosures 
with LPG and fuel. In addition, where in the past the denominator used was 'volumes sold' (in line with the ﬁnancial disclosures of the Company), we now used 
the more relevant reference 'volumes produced'. As a result of the scope extension of emission data and the change in denominator, the restated intensity ratios 
are higher than previously reported. Scope 1 GHG intensity ratio for natural gas was restated by +7.4% for the average of the years 2019-2020-2021 (combined, 
including joint ventures) and Scope 2 GHG intensity ratio from purchased electricity and other types of energy was restated by +6.6% over the same period. GRI 2-4

The data includes independent contractors working at BlackBerry facilities. Independent contractors are individuals that own independent 
businesses and BlackBerry has hired full-time. 
Rates are calculated based on 200,000 hours worked. “Days” refers to calendar days. “Lost days” begin on the first day missed after the injury day. Absentee days are not reported on and, thus, 
have not been subject to external assurance.  
Incident types included in the aggregated calculation of lost time rates are: a) medical aid required b) first did required c) injury – no 
treatment required. Musculoskeletal disorders are reported as injuries. Injuries requiring only first aid treatment are excluded. Commuting accidents are included when required by local legislation. No fatalities were experienced.

The data includes independent contractors working at BlackBerry facilities. Independent contractors are individuals that own independent 
businesses and BlackBerry has hired full-time. 
Rates are calculated based on 200,000 hours worked. “Days” refers to calendar days. “Lost days” begin on the first day missed after the injury day. Absentee days are not reported on and, thus, 
have not been subject to external assurance.  
Incident types included in the aggregated calculation of lost time rates are: a) medical aid required b) first did required c) injury – no 
treatment required. Musculoskeletal disorders are reported as injuries. Injuries requiring only first aid treatment are excluded. Commuting accidents are included when required by local legislation. No fatalities were experienced.  
BlackBerry records and reports incident statistics using the International Labour Organization  (ILO) Code of Practice, with the  
following exceptions: 
•
 Incident, fr

The data includes independent contractors working at BlackBerry facilities. Independent contractors are individuals that own independent 
businesses and BlackBerry has hired full-time. 
Rates are calculated based on 200,000 hours worked. “Days” refers to calendar days. “Lost days” begin on the first day missed after the injury day. Absentee days are not reported on and, thus, 
have not been subject to external assurance.  
Incident types included in the aggregated calculation of lost time rates are: a) medical aid required b) first did required c) injury – no 
treatment required. Musculoskeletal disorders are reported as injuries. Injuries requiring only first aid treatment are excluded. Commuting accidents are included when required by local legislation. No fatalities were experienced.  
BlackBerry records and reports incident statistics using the International Labour Organization  (ILO) Code of Practice, with the

Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions have increased year-over-year as our workforce grew and returned to the Company’s 
office locations in Canada and the United Kingdom throughout the year in accordance with our Return to Office 
Work Plan. Blackline Safety will continue to closely track emissions from these sources and look for ways to reduce its overall impact in order to achieve its net-zero emissions target by 2023.

OUR COMMITMENT
We understand the impacts associated with GHG emissions and other air pollutants, including linkages to climate 
change, public health concerns and threats to ecosystems. We also recognize that emission reductions are often a 
signal of improving overall operational efficiency at our manufacturing facilities. We therefore see our focus on emission 
reductions as a potential competitive advantage, and we look to partner with our customers and others who share our 
goal of reducing emissions impacts across the value chain. We monitor our emissions closely and work to minimize 
our respective impacts in support of maintaining compliance with our regulatory obligations and reducing our global 
environmental footprint. 
GRI 103-1
OUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH
The overall management strategy for our emission 
reduction program is led by our business segments, 
regions and individual facilities. We continue to look to 
develop and implement cost-effective technologies that 
help meet both our emission reduction and our operational 
efficiency goals. We engage closely with governments 
in the areas where we operate, as they aim to reduce 
industrial and commercial sources of emissions in their 
communities. Often, this engagement is through our active 
participation and leadership in various industry groups. 
GRI 103-2  |  GRI 103-3
OUR PERFORMANCE
By the end of 2018, we had realized 50% of our 2025 GHG 
reduction target. This was achieved through efforts to 
capture waste heat and offset our purchase of electricity 
and by improving our process yields through technology, 
product selection and feedstock selection. Looking 
forward, additional process technology improvements are 
under development for deployment at one of our recently 
announced expansions in Asia, with the expectation that 
this technology could be deployed at other facilities. CO 2GHG EMISSIONS 2016 2017 2018

OUR COMMITMENT
We understand the impacts associated with GHG emissions and other air pollutants, including linkages to climate 
change, public health concerns and threats to ecosystems. We also recognize that emission reductions are often a 
signal of improving overall operational efficiency at our manufacturing facilities. We therefore see our focus on emission 
reductions as a potential competitive advantage, and we look to partner with our customers and others who share our 
goal of reducing emissions impacts across the value chain. We monitor our emissions closely and work to minimize 
our respective impacts in support of maintaining compliance with our regulatory obligations and reducing our global 
environmental footprint. 
GRI 103-1
OUR MANAGEMENT APPROACH
The overall management strategy for our emission 
reduction program is led by our business segments, 
regions and individual facilities. We continue to look to 
develop and implement cost-effective technologies that 
help meet both our emission reduction and our operational 
efficiency goals. We engage closely with governments 
in the areas where we operate, as they aim to reduce 
industrial and commercial sources of emissions in their 
communities. Often, this engagement is through our active 
participation and leadership in various industry groups. 
GRI 103-2  |  GRI 103-3
OUR PERFORMANCE
By the end of 2018, we had realized 50% of our 2025 GHG 
reduction target. This was achieved through efforts to 
capture waste heat and offset our purchase of electricity 
and by improving our process yields through technology, 
product selection and feedstock selection. Looking 
forward, additional process technology improvements are 
under development for deployment at one of our recently 
announced expansions in Asia, with the expectation that 
this technology could be deployed at other facilities. CO 2GHG EMISSIONS 2016 2017 2018

1) Air emissions are calculated using industry standards and best practices in the associated jurisdiction for which our Operations take place 
(including Western Climate Initiative for British Columbia, Alberta Greenhouse Gas Quantification Methodologies under the TIER Regulation 
for Alberta, The Management and Reduction of Greenhouse Gases for Saskatchewan, and Environment and Climate Change Canada’s 
National Inventory Report). Emissions quantification methodologies were revised during 2021 to align with several changes to these 
recognized industry standards, and in doing so were responsible for the vast majority of the apparent year-over-year emissions increase. As 
an example, the direct emissions increase from 2019 levels would have only been 1%, as compared to the above indicated 23%, had current 
emissions quantification methodology been applied in 2019.
2) Spills reported to a regulatory agency, as required in the jurisdiction where a spill occurs, excluding fresh water spills.
3) Recordable injuries include fatalities, permanent total disabilities, lost work cases, restricted work cases and medical treatment cases .

1) Air emissions are calculated using industry standards and best practices in the associated jurisdiction for which our Operations take place 
(including Western Climate Initiative for British Columbia, Alberta Greenhouse Gas Quantification Methodologies under the TIER Regulation 
for Alberta, The Management and Reduction of Greenhouse Gases for Saskatchewan, and Environment and Climate Change Canada’s 
National Inventory Report). Emissions quantification methodologies were revised during 2021 to align with several changes to these 
recognized industry standards, and in doing so were responsible for the vast majority of the apparent year-over-year emissions increase. As 
an example, the direct emissions increase from 2019 levels would have only been 1%, as compared to the above indicated 23%, had current 
emissions quantification methodology been applied in 2019.
2) Spills reported to a regulatory agency, as required in the jurisdiction where a spill occurs, excluding fresh water spills.
3) Recordable injuries include fatalities, permanent total disabilities, lost work cases, restricted work cases and medical treatment cases .

JPMorgan Chase’s operational GHG footprint stems from two primary activities: powering our buildings (e.g., electricity, heating 
and cooling) and business travel. Scope 2 emissions, from purchased electricity, are the largest driver of our building-related emissions and overall operational GHG footprint. The majority of our business travel-related emissions are Scope 3 emissions from commercially operated air and rail; reimbursed personal vehicle and rental car travel; and hotel stays. A small portion of our business travel emissions are Scope 1 emissions from company-owned aircraft and vehicles.

The largest contributor to our operational GHG footprint is purchased electricity, which is why our strategy for carbon neutral operations is principally focused on reducing energy use and sourcing renewable energy. To that end, in 2017, we set a goal to source renewable energy for 100% of our global power needs on an annual basis, beginning in 2020. We met our goal in 2020 by generating and purchasing renewable energy and corresponding EACs in an amount equivalent to the total megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity that our firm consumed globally throughout the year. We intend to maintain our commitment to carbon neutral operations — and to do so in a way that maximizes positive impact. Moving forward, we will continue to support the development of renewable energy, including by installing on-site renewable energy systems and executing long-term renewable energy procurement agreements. We have set a goal that these solutions will make up 70% or more of our renewable energy procurement, with the remainder satisfied by applicable EACs. In parallel, to drive progress in efficiency and reduce our energy use, in 2021 we announced a new target to cut our Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) emissions by 40% by 2030, over our 2017 baseline.

JPMorgan Chase’s operational GHG footprint stems from two primary activities: powering our buildings (e.g., electricity, heating 
and cooling) and business travel. Scope 2 emissions, from purchased electricity, are the largest driver of our building-related emissions and overall operational GHG footprint. The majority of our business travel-related emissions are Scope 3 emissions from commercially operated air and rail; reimbursed personal vehicle and rental car travel; and hotel stays. A small portion of our business travel emissions are Scope 1 emissions from company-owned aircraft and vehicles.

Buildings, Branches and Data Centers
The largest contributor to our operational GHG footprint is purchased electricity, which is why our strategy for carbon neutral operations is principally focused on reducing energy use and sourcing renewable energy. To that end, in 2017, we set a goal to source renewable energy for 100% of our global power needs on an annual basis, beginning in 2020. We met our goal in 2020 by generating and purchasing renewable energy and corresponding EACs in an amount equivalent to the total megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity that our firm consumed globally throughout the year. We intend to maintain our commitment to carbon neutral operations — and to do so in a way that maximizes positive impact. Moving forward, we will continue to support the development of renewable energy, including by installing on-site renewable energy systems and executing long-term renewable energy procurement agreements. We have set a goal that these solutions will make up 70% or more of our renewable energy procurement, with the remainder satisfied by applicable EACs. In parallel, to drive progress in efficiency and reduce our energy use, in 2021 we announced a new target to cut our Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) emissions by 40% by 2030, over our 2017 baseline.

In 2022, our initial year of gathering GHG emissions data, we 
engaged with a leading carbon analytics and management

building in South San Francisco, California, is LEED 
Gold-certified. Its innovative Automated Logic 
Controls Building Management System allows 
building personnel to manage energy consumption 
in every lab, private office and open office area in 
the facility. Smart thermostats detect motion in each 
zone and manage ventilation accordingly.
Our laboratory fume hoods use Critical Room 
Control exhaust valves that moderate incoming air 
and control hood exhaust based on the height of 
the fume hood sash. All hoods are equipped with 
automatic sash closers that activate whenever a 
researcher steps away from their hood.
All building fixtures have high-efficiency LED lamps, 
and light fixtures near windows have automatic 
controls that turn off or dim the lamp based on 
natural light entering the area. All rooms have 
occupancy sensors that turn off lights when people 
leave.
Finally, our restrooms feature highly water-efficient 
touchless faucets and low-flow toilets.

* The calculation of the CO 2eq (which includes CH4, NO2, HFC, PFC and SF6 emissions, when present) was carried out in accordance with the indications contained in the “Global 
Warming Potential Values” guide from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (calculation methodology and emission factors as per the GHG Protocol. See http://www.ghgprotocol.org/
calculation-tools/all-tools), which is based on the latest scientific studies carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): “IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, 2014 (AR5)”, “IPCC fourth assessment report, 2007 (AR4)” and “IPCC second assessment report, 1995 (SAR)”, supplemented by data from the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) for US emissions and ASHRAE34 for coolants. The 2016 and 2017 data does not include the plant in Langfang (China), acquired in 2016, as some utilities and some general systems are still shared with other activities that are not controlled by Brembo.
** The figure includes the quantities of coolants dispersed into the atmosphere and reported in the special registers when air conditioning systems are refilled periodically. In the 
absence of such a record or other evidence of gas refills carried out during the year, all the gas contained in the air conditioning systems is considered to be dispersed into the atmosphere — as a precautionary measure.
Scope 1
Climate-changing emissions generated 
directly by Brembo come from plants, assets and vehicles operated directly by the Company. This scope includes emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in melting furnaces, leakage of coolants in air conditioning systems or use of the company fleet.
 Scope 2
Indirect emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from the generation of electricity purchased by Brembo, as well as the heating of water/steam procured by the Group through district heating systems. With these purchases Brembo indirectly contributes to the emissions generated by electricity or heat suppliers. Scope 3
Emissions that are not included in the previous scopes linked to Brembo’s value chain. This scope includes emissions from Brembo product distribution and handling among plants, personnel commuting from home to workplace or business trips.",2127

directly by Brembo come from plants, assets and vehicles operated directly by the Company. This scope includes emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in melting furnaces, leakage of coolants in air conditioning systems or use of the company fleet.
 Scope 2
Indirect emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from the generation of electricity purchased by Brembo, as well as the heating of water/steam procured by the Group through district heating systems. With these purchases Brembo indirectly contributes to the emissions generated by electricity or heat suppliers. Scope 3

* The calculation of the CO 2eq (which includes CH4, NO2, HFC, PFC and SF6 emissions, when present) was carried out in accordance with the indications contained in the “Global 
Warming Potential Values” guide from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (calculation methodology and emission factors as per the GHG Protocol. See http://www.ghgprotocol.org/
calculation-tools/all-tools), which is based on the latest scientific studies carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): “IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, 2014 (AR5)”, “IPCC fourth assessment report, 2007 (AR4)” and “IPCC second assessment report, 1995 (SAR)”, supplemented by data from the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) for US emissions and ASHRAE34 for coolants. The 2016 and 2017 data does not include the plant in Langfang (China), acquired in 2016, as some utilities and some general systems are still shared with other activities that are not controlled by Brembo.
** The figure includes the quantities of coolants dispersed into the atmosphere and reported in the special registers when air conditioning systems are refilled periodically. In the 
absence of such a record or other evidence of gas refills carried out during the year, all the gas contained in the air conditioning systems is considered to be dispersed into the atmosphere — as a precautionary measure.
Scope 1
Climate-changing emissions generated 
directly by Brembo come from plants, assets and vehicles operated directly by the Company. This scope includes emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in melting furnaces, leakage of coolants in air conditioning systems or use of the company fleet.
 Scope 2
Indirect emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from the generation of electricity purchased by Brembo, as well as the heating of water/steam procured by the Group through district heating systems. With these purchases Brembo indirectly contributes to the emissions generated by electricity or heat suppliers. Scope 3
Emissions that are not included in the previous scopes linked to Brembo’s value chain. This scope includes emissions from Brembo product distribution and handling among plants, personnel commuting from home to workplace or business trips.",2159

GRANITE CONSTRUCTION  2020 Sustainability Report66CARBON FOOTPRINT ASSESSMENT
Scope 1
2020 OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT: 
Our emissions are directly correlated to business volumes and fluctuations in each year, so our 
approach is to compare emissions as they relate to annual revenues. We shared our first Scope 1 
assessment in our 2016 Sustainability Progress Report and use the 2015 baseline therein to assess 
our progress. We did not meet our 2020 objective to reduce GHG emissions/fuel consumption 
associated with mobile fleet and asphalt plant operations by two percent year-over-year. Emissions 
increased in total and as normalized per revenue. This increase is primarily due to growth through 
acquisition, which increased the size of our fleet and shifted the balance of emissions as normalized by 
revenue in new markets.
Our Scope 1 assessment follows the Greenhouse Gas Protocol principles and methodologies 
established by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and includes carbon dioxide, 
methane, and nitrous oxide, reported in equivalent CO2 (US tons) where available. The following 
emissions sources were included:
• Mobile sources (light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles/equipment and corporate jet)
• Rental equipment is not included; however, some fuel consumption from rental equipment is 
included (dependent on agreements)
• Calculations are based on bulk fuel combustion for CO2 only; methane and nitrous oxide 
emissions factors for mobile equipment are not included due to data gaps; we are currently 
implementing a solution to address these gaps
• Inliner thermal processing (fuel used to heat water for liner curing process; includes CO2 only)
• Asphalt plant production (includes CO2 Equivalents)
• Granite-owned diesel generators (includes CO2 Equivalents)
• Indoor heating of Granite-owned facilities where provided by fuel combustion (primarily natural 
gas; CO2 only)132,285

Greenhouse Gas Emission Amount of calculated greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted to air reported in 
CO2e.
Scope 1 GHGs Direct scope 1 emissions include greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that 
occur related to energy from Lundbeck's four productions sites and four 
additional Lundbeck sites. Includes consumption of gas, oil and 
refrigerants used in production (e.g. emissions associated with fuel 
combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles).
All consumed energy is monitored by building specific meter readings or 
invoices. The quantity of consumed energy sources is multiplied by 
relevant emission factors provided by UK Department for Environment, 
Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
Emissions from Lundbeck’s owned or controlled vehicle fleet is provided 
directly by the associated leasing company or calculated based on 
consumed fuel multiplied with relevant emission factors. Primary data 
from an estimated 43% of the company cars are retrieved and used to 
estimate emissions from Lundbeck’s full fleet activity.
Scope 2 GHGs (location based) Scope 2 emissions includes all indirect emissions related to the 
generation of acquired and consumed electricity and district heating at 
Lundbeck's four production sites and four additional Lundbeck sites. All 
consumed energy is monitored by building specific meter readings and 
invoices if meter readings not available.
The emissions are reported as location based and derived from 
consumed energy multiplied with relevant location based emission 
factors provided by DEFRA.
 Scope 2 GHGs (market based) Includes all indirect emissions related to the generation of acquired and 
consumed electricity and district heating on all Lundbeck sites. All 
consumed energy is monitored by building specific meter readings or 
invoices.
The emissions are reported primarily as market based emissions, where 
consumed scope 2 energy is multiplied with market specific emission 
factors provided directly from the energy supplier. Where market 
specific emissions are not available, the best available location based 
emission factors provided by DEFRA are used for the reporting in line 
with the GHG protocol hierarchy.
Scope 1 & 2 GHGs (market based) Combines the calculated scope 1 and scope 2 emissions using the 
reported market based scope 2 emissions.CLIMATE AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT 
Lundbeck is committed to achieving a zero-carbon 
economy and setting science-based targets. In 2020, 
we had a new science-based target approved. See the 
Climate change & circularity  chapter of this report.
EU TAXONOMY
Lundbeck is not eligible to report under the current 
EU taxonomy for sustainable activities, as it relates only to industries with business models focused on 
generating revenue from activities that make a 
substantial contribution to the mitigation of climate 
change or environmental damage. Our business 
model is focused on generating revenue from 
activities that contribute to sustainable activities 
related to healthcare and will not be eligible until a 
social impact dimension of the EU taxonomy is 
developed.

Greenhouse Gas Emission Amount of calculated greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted to air reported in 
CO2e.
Scope 1 GHGs Direct scope 1 emissions include greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that 
occur related to energy from Lundbeck's four productions sites and four 
additional Lundbeck sites. Includes consumption of gas, oil and 
refrigerants used in production (e.g. emissions associated with fuel 
combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles).
All consumed energy is monitored by building specific meter readings or 
invoices. The quantity of consumed energy sources is multiplied by 
relevant emission factors provided by UK Department for Environment, 
Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
Emissions from Lundbeck’s owned or controlled vehicle fleet is provided 
directly by the associated leasing company or calculated based on 
consumed fuel multiplied with relevant emission factors. Primary data 
from an estimated 43% of the company cars are retrieved and used to 
estimate emissions from Lundbeck’s full fleet activity.
Scope 2 GHGs (location based) Scope 2 emissions includes all indirect emissions related to the 
generation of acquired and consumed electricity and district heating at 
Lundbeck's four production sites and four additional Lundbeck sites. All 
consumed energy is monitored by building specific meter readings and 
invoices if meter readings not available.
The emissions are reported as location based and derived from 
consumed energy multiplied with relevant location based emission 
factors provided by DEFRA.
 Scope 2 GHGs (market based) Includes all indirect emissions related to the generation of acquired and 
consumed electricity and district heating on all Lundbeck sites. All 
consumed energy is monitored by building specific meter readings or 
invoices.
The emissions are reported primarily as market based emissions, where 
consumed scope 2 energy is multiplied with market specific emission 
factors provided directly from the energy supplier. Where market 
specific emissions are not available, the best available location based 
emission factors provided by DEFRA are used for the reporting in line 
with the GHG protocol hierarchy.
Scope 1 & 2 GHGs (market based) Combines the calculated scope 1 and scope 2 emissions using the 
reported market based scope 2 emissions.CLIMATE AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT 
Lundbeck is committed to achieving a zero-carbon 
economy and setting science-based targets. In 2020, 
we had a new science-based target approved. See the

EU TAXONOMY
Lundbeck is not eligible to report under the current 
EU taxonomy for sustainable activities, as it relates only to industries with business models focused on 
generating revenue from activities that make a 
substantial contribution to the mitigation of climate 
change or environmental damage. Our business

Greenhouse Gas Emission Amount of calculated greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted to air reported in 
CO2e.
Scope 1 GHGs Direct scope 1 emissions include greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that 
occur related to energy from Lundbeck's four productions sites and four 
additional Lundbeck sites. Includes consumption of gas, oil and 
refrigerants used in production (e.g. emissions associated with fuel 
combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles).
All consumed energy is monitored by building specific meter readings or 
invoices. The quantity of consumed energy sources is multiplied by 
relevant emission factors provided by UK Department for Environment, 
Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
Emissions from Lundbeck’s owned or controlled vehicle fleet is provided 
directly by the associated leasing company or calculated based on 
consumed fuel multiplied with relevant emission factors. Primary data 
from an estimated 43% of the company cars are retrieved and used to 
estimate emissions from Lundbeck’s full fleet activity.
Scope 2 GHGs (location based) Scope 2 emissions includes all indirect emissions related to the 
generation of acquired and consumed electricity and district heating at 
Lundbeck's four production sites and four additional Lundbeck sites. All 
consumed energy is monitored by building specific meter readings and 
invoices if meter readings not available.
The emissions are reported as location based and derived from 
consumed energy multiplied with relevant location based emission 
factors provided by DEFRA.
 Scope 2 GHGs (market based) Includes all indirect emissions related to the generation of acquired and 
consumed electricity and district heating on all Lundbeck sites. All 
consumed energy is monitored by building specific meter readings or 
invoices.
The emissions are reported primarily as market based emissions, where 
consumed scope 2 energy is multiplied with market specific emission 
factors provided directly from the energy supplier. Where market 
specific emissions are not available, the best available location based 
emission factors provided by DEFRA are used for the reporting in line 
with the GHG protocol hierarchy.
Scope 1 & 2 GHGs (market based) Combines the calculated scope 1 and scope 2 emissions using the 
reported market based scope 2 emissions.CLIMATE AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT 
Lundbeck is committed to achieving a zero-carbon 
economy and setting science-based targets. In 2020, 
we had a new science-based target approved. See the 
Climate change & circularity  chapter of this report.
EU TAXONOMY
Lundbeck is not eligible to report under the current 
EU taxonomy for sustainable activities, as it relates only to industries with business models focused on 
generating revenue from activities that make a 
substantial contribution to the mitigation of climate 
change or environmental damage. Our business 
model is focused on generating revenue from 
activities that contribute to sustainable activities 
related to healthcare and will not be eligible until a 
social impact dimension of the EU taxonomy is 
developed.

In line with requirements set out in the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, this statement 
reports the Company’s GHG emissions for the reporting period  
1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021. Our GHG emissions reporting 
period is the same as the financial reporting year, in accordance with 
the DEFRA Environmental Reporting Guidance. The data has been 
calculated and recorded in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) Protocol and ISO 14064.  This guidance codifies using both 
market and location-based methods for scope 2 accounting, the 
methodology applied is explained further in our appendix document, 
Sustainability Basis of Reporting 2021. 
Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting
The carbon emissions and energy consumption is reported in  
accordance with  the requirements of the Streamlined Energy and 
Carbon Reporting (SECR).  We have included the previous year’s data 
to provide a year-on-year comparison.Independent assurance
Total Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3, and Total GHG emissions intensity 
data have been independently assured by Deloitte LLP who have 
carried out limited assurance in accordance with the International 
Standards on Assurance Engagements 3000. Their assurance 
statement is available in the Sustainability Report 2021.
Reporting boundaries
We have adopted operational control as our reporting approach. GHG 
emissions data is provided for those assets where we have authority to 
introduce and implement operating policies.
This includes properties held in joint ventures where JV Board 
approval is required. We have reported 100% of GHG emissions data 
for these reported assets. It excludes the Value Retail portfolio where 
we do not have authority to introduce or implement operating policies. 
A detailed basis of reporting statement and full list of operating 
entities and assets included within the reporting boundary can be

In line with requirements set out in the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, this statement 
reports the Company’s GHG emissions for the reporting period  
1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021. Our GHG emissions reporting 
period is the same as the financial reporting year, in accordance with 
the DEFRA Environmental Reporting Guidance. The data has been 
calculated and recorded in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) Protocol and ISO 14064.  This guidance codifies using both 
market and location-based methods for scope 2 accounting, the 
methodology applied is explained further in our appendix document, 
Sustainability Basis of Reporting 2021. 
Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting
The carbon emissions and energy consumption is reported in  
accordance with  the requirements of the Streamlined Energy and 
Carbon Reporting (SECR).  We have included the previous year’s data 
to provide a year-on-year comparison.Independent assurance
Total Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3, and Total GHG emissions intensity 
data have been independently assured by Deloitte LLP who have 
carried out limited assurance in accordance with the International 
Standards on Assurance Engagements 3000. Their assurance 
statement is available in the Sustainability Report 2021.
Reporting boundaries
We have adopted operational control as our reporting approach. GHG 
emissions data is provided for those assets where we have authority to 
introduce and implement operating policies.
This includes properties held in joint ventures where JV Board 
approval is required. We have reported 100% of GHG emissions data 
for these reported assets. It excludes the Value Retail portfolio where 
we do not have authority to introduce or implement operating policies. 
A detailed basis of reporting statement and full list of operating 
entities and assets included within the reporting boundary can be 
found on our website www.hammerson.com.Greenhouse gas emissions 2021
Table 100
Basis of reporting
Baseline year 2015
Boundary summary All assets and facilities under Hammerson’s direct operational control are included.
Consistency with financial statements Consistency with the financial statements and reporting period are set out above.
Emissions factor data source We have sourced our emissions factors from 2021 DEFRA GHG Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting, and additional sources including, but not limited, to International Energy Agency and Engie.
Assessment methodology GHG Protocol and ISO 14064 (2006).
Materiality threshold Activities generating emissions of <5% relative to total Group emissions have been excluded.
Intensity ratio Denominator is common parts area for the year ended 31 December 2021 of  455,097 sqm. In  
previous years, the denominator used was adjusted profit before tax, however, following the disposal  
of substantially all of the remaining UK retail parks, common parts area has been determined as a  
more relevant metric.
Target 15% reduction in carbon emissions intensity by 2021 against 2019 baseline using the  
location-based approach.

LED upgrades
There are significant benefits from upgrading 
our existing light fittings with LED. Not only 
do they provide improved aesthetics for our 
work environment, but they also consume 
a lot less energy and by extension emit less 
carbon. LEDs are also a more durable product, 
which require less maintenance and produce 
less waste.
Following a successful pilot at Laverty’s 
laboratory located in North Ryde, Sydney, 
Healius is rolling out LED across our portfolio 
where we don’t already have LEDs installed. 
The multi-year LED upgrade program will 
continue until FY 2025 where we aim to have 
upgraded all feasible sites.
To date, we have completed upgrades at 
11 sites and replaced 1,863 lights with LEDs, 
resulting in an estimated energy saving 
of 495,000 kWh, and reducing our carbon 
emissions by 383.1 tonnes in the year and 
440 tonnes annually going forward.
For our existing light fittings, Healius is 
committed to responsible waste management, 
where all globes are recycled using certified 
fluorescent globe recyclers, Lamp Recyclers, 
to ensure any mercury bearing waste is 
appropriately treated and recycled, reducing 
what gets sent to landfills. All salvageable 
metal is also recycled where possible.

1 Over 95% of our indirect emissions are related to electricity purchased from the grid in Peru. We have calculated this using an emissions factor provided by the Peruvian government that did not change between 2015 and 2019 despite a changing composition of generation. In 2020, 
after publishing our 2019 report, a revised factor for 2019 was developed by the government that was approximately one-third of the previous factor, but it was not officially issued. The Peruvian government developed an updated factor for 2020 that is in the same range as the 2019 
figure, but it was not officially published either. We have elected to continue to use the previous, higher factor while we wait for the newer factors to be made official and publicly accessible – once the new factors are declared official, we will publish an updated GHG analysis at this link .
2 We have had zero SOX emissions from stationary sources since we closed the smelter in Manitoba in 2010.
3 In Manitoba, we collect and report on fugitive dust. Collection and reporting at the same level of detail is not required in Peru. Ambient monitoring is conducted and confirmed to be in compliance with regulatory requirements, but total particulate release data is not collected.",2611

1 Over 95% of our indirect emissions are related to electricity purchased from the grid in Peru. We have calculated this using an emissions factor provided by the Peruvian government that did not change between 2015 and 2019 despite a changing composition of generation. In 2020, 
after publishing our 2019 report, a revised factor for 2019 was developed by the government that was approximately one-third of the previous factor, but it was not officially issued. The Peruvian government developed an updated factor for 2020 that is in the same range as the 2019 
figure, but it was not officially published either. We have elected to continue to use the previous, higher factor while we wait for the newer factors to be made official and publicly accessible – once the new factors are declared official, we will publish an updated GHG analysis at this link .
2 We have had zero SOX emissions from stationary sources since we closed the smelter in Manitoba in 2010.
3 In Manitoba, we collect and report on fugitive dust. Collection and reporting at the same level of detail is not required in Peru. Ambient monitoring is conducted and confirmed to be in compliance with regulatory requirements, but total particulate release data is not collected.",2612

our operations originate from purchased electricity. The indirect 
CO2 emissions are highly dependent on the mix of the energy 
sources available in the operating countries’ national energy 
grids. A project to investigate options to increase renewable 
energy will start in 2019.
Our emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) are mainly 
related to solvent-based printing inks. Our manufacturing 
units with recognizable VOC emissions typically have a VOC 
incinerator or a VOC recovery unit installed. The recovery system 
enables recycling and reuse of the solvent used in printing 
inks. We also use water-based printing inks, which are solvent 
free and do not result in VOC emissions (although they require 
greater use of energy for evaporation). In 2018, 16% (16%) of 
printing inks used in the Group were water- or oil-based.
Waste 
306-2 Waste by type and disposal method
The main waste streams in our processes are cutting waste 
from paperboard packaging manufacturing, materials rejected 
during the fiber pulping process, and plastic waste. Cutting 
waste from our paperboard packaging manufacturing is either 
recycled as raw material for fiber packaging inside the Group or 
sent for external recycling. In general, material recovery refers to 
either internal or external recycling. The waste disposal method 
is determined on the manufacturing unit level based on the 
available infrastructure and type of waste.  
Our total amount of waste increased 4%, mainly due to 
growth in our Foodservice and North America segments. 
The amount of hazardous waste represented 4% (4%) of the 
total waste amount. Hazardous waste was treated locally by 
dedicated hazardous waste handlers in line with local regulatory 
requirements.2018 2017 2016 2015 2014

our operations originate from purchased electricity. The indirect 
CO2 emissions are highly dependent on the mix of the energy 
sources available in the operating countries’ national energy 
grids. A project to investigate options to increase renewable 
energy will start in 2019.
Our emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) are mainly 
related to solvent-based printing inks. Our manufacturing 
units with recognizable VOC emissions typically have a VOC 
incinerator or a VOC recovery unit installed. The recovery system 
enables recycling and reuse of the solvent used in printing 
inks. We also use water-based printing inks, which are solvent 
free and do not result in VOC emissions (although they require 
greater use of energy for evaporation). In 2018, 16% (16%) of 
printing inks used in the Group were water- or oil-based.
Waste 
306-2 Waste by type and disposal method
The main waste streams in our processes are cutting waste 
from paperboard packaging manufacturing, materials rejected 
during the fiber pulping process, and plastic waste. Cutting 
waste from our paperboard packaging manufacturing is either 
recycled as raw material for fiber packaging inside the Group or 
sent for external recycling. In general, material recovery refers to 
either internal or external recycling. The waste disposal method 
is determined on the manufacturing unit level based on the 
available infrastructure and type of waste.  
Our total amount of waste increased 4%, mainly due to 
growth in our Foodservice and North America segments. 
The amount of hazardous waste represented 4% (4%) of the 
total waste amount. Hazardous waste was treated locally by 
dedicated hazardous waste handlers in line with local regulatory 
requirements.2018 2017 2016 2015 2014

organic compounds (VOC).
Our absolute Scope 1 emissions increased in 2019 by 6% com -
pared to 2018. Scope 1 emissions cover methane (CH4) and nitrous 
oxide (N2O) gases besides CO2. Emissions are calculated based on 
reported	fuel	consumption	and	emission	factors	according	to	GHG 	
Protocol/IEA 2018.
Our	Scope	2	emissions	stayed	essentially	flat	in	2019	compared 	
to	2018.	The	emissions	are	calculated	according	to	a	location-based 	
method,	based	on	reported	secondary	energy	consumption	and 	
emission factors. Emissions factors are calculated according to GHG 
Protocol/IEA 2018. Due to updates of emission factors under IEA 
2018, data of previous years for both Scope 1 and 2 emissions have 
slightly changed from 2018 report.
Our GHG intensity per sellable ton produced decreased by 1% 
in 2019 compared to 2018. Given the reduced energy intensity, 
we have reduced the GHG emissions by 8,000 metric tons of CO2 
equivalent	compared	to	2018	when	corrected	for	the	production 	
volume.	The	emission	intensity	and	reduction	cover	Scope	1	and 	
Scope 2 emissions.
71% of total greenhouse gas emissions generated by our 
operations	originate	from	purchased	electricity.	The	indirect	CO2 emissions are highly dependent on the mix of the energy sources 
available	in	the	operating	countries’	national	energy	grids.
Our	emissions	of	Volatile	Organic	Compounds	(VOC)	are	mainly 	
related	to	solvent-based	printing	inks.	Our	manufacturing	units	with 	
recognizable VOC emissions typically have a VOC incinerator or a 
VOC recovery unit installed. The recovery system enables recycling 
and	reuse	of	the	solvent	used	in	printing	inks.	We	also	use	water-
based	printing	inks,	which	are	solvent	free	and	do	not	result	in	VOC 	
emissions (although they require greater use of energy for evapo -
ration).	In	2019,	16% 	(16%)	of	printing	inks	used	in	Huhtamaki	were 	
water- or oil-based.
One	way	to	reduce	emissions	(apart	from	energy	initiatives 	
mentioned	above)	is	to	leverage	digital	tools	to	collaborate	across 	
the globe, thereby reducing the need to travel. We started a digital 
workplace	initiative	in	2018	and	continued	developing	it	in	2019. 	
This involved redesigning our digital ways of working as well as 
renewing	our	digital	collaboration	tools,	including	online	meeting 	
and team work tools, instant messaging, email and intranet. During

2018, data of previous years for both Scope 1 and 2 emissions have 
slightly changed from 2018 report.
Our GHG intensity per sellable ton produced decreased by 1% 
in 2019 compared to 2018. Given the reduced energy intensity, 
we have reduced the GHG emissions by 8,000 metric tons of CO2 
equivalent	compared	to	2018	when	corrected	for	the	production 	
volume.	The	emission	intensity	and	reduction	cover	Scope	1	and 	
Scope 2 emissions.
71% of total greenhouse gas emissions generated by our 
operations	originate	from	purchased	electricity.	The	indirect	CO2 emissions are highly dependent on the mix of the energy sources 
available	in	the	operating	countries’	national	energy	grids.
Our	emissions	of	Volatile	Organic	Compounds	(VOC)	are	mainly 	
related	to	solvent-based	printing	inks.	Our	manufacturing	units	with 	
recognizable VOC emissions typically have a VOC incinerator or a 
VOC recovery unit installed. The recovery system enables recycling 
and	reuse	of	the	solvent	used	in	printing	inks.	We	also	use	water-
based	printing	inks,	which	are	solvent	free	and	do	not	result	in	VOC 	
emissions (although they require greater use of energy for evapo -
ration).	In	2019,	16% 	(16%)	of	printing	inks	used	in	Huhtamaki	were 	
water- or oil-based.
One	way	to	reduce	emissions	(apart	from	energy	initiatives 	
mentioned	above)	is	to	leverage	digital	tools	to	collaborate	across 	
the globe, thereby reducing the need to travel. We started a digital 
workplace	initiative	in	2018	and	continued	developing	it	in	2019. 	
This involved redesigning our digital ways of working as well as 
renewing	our	digital	collaboration	tools,	including	online	meeting 	
and team work tools, instant messaging, email and intranet. During 
2019,	a	total	of	56,687	online	meetings	were	organized	in	the	com -

organic compounds (VOC).
Our absolute Scope 1 emissions increased in 2019 by 6% com -
pared to 2018. Scope 1 emissions cover methane (CH4) and nitrous 
oxide (N2O) gases besides CO2. Emissions are calculated based on 
reported	fuel	consumption	and	emission	factors	according	to	GHG 	
Protocol/IEA 2018.
Our	Scope	2	emissions	stayed	essentially	flat	in	2019	compared 	
to	2018.	The	emissions	are	calculated	according	to	a	location-based 	
method,	based	on	reported	secondary	energy	consumption	and 	
emission factors. Emissions factors are calculated according to GHG 
Protocol/IEA 2018. Due to updates of emission factors under IEA 
2018, data of previous years for both Scope 1 and 2 emissions have 
slightly changed from 2018 report.
Our GHG intensity per sellable ton produced decreased by 1% 
in 2019 compared to 2018. Given the reduced energy intensity, 
we have reduced the GHG emissions by 8,000 metric tons of CO2 
equivalent	compared	to	2018	when	corrected	for	the	production 	
volume.	The	emission	intensity	and	reduction	cover	Scope	1	and 	
Scope 2 emissions.
71% of total greenhouse gas emissions generated by our 
operations	originate	from	purchased	electricity.	The	indirect	CO2 emissions are highly dependent on the mix of the energy sources 
available	in	the	operating	countries’	national	energy	grids.
Our	emissions	of	Volatile	Organic	Compounds	(VOC)	are	mainly 	
related	to	solvent-based	printing	inks.	Our	manufacturing	units	with 	
recognizable VOC emissions typically have a VOC incinerator or a 
VOC recovery unit installed. The recovery system enables recycling 
and	reuse	of	the	solvent	used	in	printing	inks.	We	also	use	water-
based	printing	inks,	which	are	solvent	free	and	do	not	result	in	VOC

In 2021 we established our GHG reduction target, to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 46% by 2030. This year we have 
made substantial progress to improve the maturity of our climate data and have undertaken detailed analysis to understand 
our exposure to CROs, which informed the development of our strategic response. When developing our response, we have 
identified the metrics to measure our progress; with these metrics we can determine the time frames that are achievable 
for our business and then identify appropriate targets. Improving the quality of our data and quantifying our CROs has 
enabled us to assess possible transition pathways that will support us to set targets and outline the time frame to deliver 
on our response. We aim to disclose this in our next reporting year. 
Our direction of travel is clear in our strategy and the Group uses a variety of metrics to measure the current and potential 
impact of our climate related risks and opportunities, including GHG emissions and business specific metrics. Our metrics 
are laid out across the seven cross-industry metric categories defined by the TCFD and 2022 is the first year of reporting. 
During 2023 we will be exploring options for a physical risk metric and internal carbon pricing.

GHG emissions
Direct GHG emissions are from our operations through combustion of fuels (Scope 1). We also purchase energy from the 
grid (Scope 2) and have indirect GHG emissions throughout the value chain mainly because of our purchase of goods, 
consumer use of vehicles and transportation, which together make up more than 95% of our total Scope 3 emissions. 
We are acting across all three Scopes and working closely with our partners to reduce GHG emissions for our business, 
our customers and our value chain. Please see pages 119 to 120 for our Streamline Energy and Carbon Emission reporting 
(SECR). We report our GHG emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, published by the WBCSD and the WRI.
We also disclose our energy intensity per square foot. This metric measures our energy efficiency and will track the impact 
of our energy saving initiatives. We chose to do this as we recognise that until the grid consists of 100% low carbon energy 
supply, the renewable energy we purchase reduces the renewable energy remaining on the grid for other users and may 
not have the decarbonisation effect at an economy level. TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

review process for all data collected in Energy Star  Portfolio Manager . Furthermore, we recommend that the 
company document within Energy  Star Portfolio Manager any unique factors related to data assumptions, 
invoices, metering, etc. at the building level to ensure replicability of performance calculations. These two process 
checks  can help ensure reliability of the data collection and consolidation processes as we ll as consistency in the 
assumptions used across the portfolio to calculate the environmental data.  
 
KRC’s GHG assertions  are that 47,588 metric tons of CO 2e were emitted in 2017 ; 4,641 metric tons of CO 2e for  
Scope 1, 42,947 metric tons of CO 2e for Scope 2. Based  on the processes and procedures conducted with a 
moderate  assurance, there is no evidence that these GHG assertions are not materially correct and are not a fair 
representation of GHG data and information, and have not been prepared in accordance with the WBSCD/WRI 
GHG Protocol  referenced above.

Renewable electricity
Last year we made a commitment to 
source all electricity used at our  European manufacturing sites from renewable sources. We have not 
only met this target but exceeded it. In 2020, all global manufacturing sites sourced their electricity from renewable sources. As a result, our scope 2 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from the electricity used at our manufacturing sites is now zero. What’s next?
To further develop our strategy to reduce our impact on the environment is a priority going forward. 
Read more about our plans to continue to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions, reduce energy and  
water consumption, and recover and reuse waste streams.  
Our focus area for the Environment is:
Minimizing impact
Seeking to understand and reduce the impact of our activities, while developing 
innovative products to help protect the environment.

www.bpaww.com Independent Third Party Assurance Statement 
To the Board and stakeholders of JetBlue Airways Corporation: 
iCompli Sustainability , a division of BPA Worldwide , was commissioned by JetBlue Airways Corporation (JetBlue) to provide independent 
assurance of specific sustainability performance data from its business activities during the period January 1 , 2019, to December 31, 2019. 
Scope 
The organizational boundary of the verification was JetBlue’s global aircraft fleet and ground facilities, as defined using the financial control 
approach. Emissions sources include jet, diesel and gasoline fuel, and electricity consumption, to verify the following specific sustainability 
performance data: 
 Scope 1 GHG emissions 
 Scope 2 GHG emissions 
Standards & Objectives 
Our assurance was managed in accordance with ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases – Specification with guidance for the validation and 
verification of greenhouse gas assertions . The objective was to provide JetBlue stakeholders with an independent ‘limited ’ level assurance 
opinion on whether : 
 The specific s ustainability performance data within JetBlue report s adheres to the ISO 14064-3 p rinciples of relevance, completeness, 
consistency, accuracy, and transparency . 
 The specific sustainability performance data within JetBlue reports are reported according to the requirements of The Climate 
Registry General Reporting Protocol (January 2016). 
Approach and Limitations 
iCompli Sustainability conducted the verification in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14064- 3: Greenhouse gases – Specification with 
guidanc e for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions . iCompli Sustainability reviewed JetBlue’s corporate “240420 JetBlue 
Footprint Calculation 2019 REISSUED (GROUND FUEL UPDATE) ” (dated April 24 , 2020) and evaluated the data for conformity with the 
requirements o f The Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol . JetBlue’s reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions were considered free 
of material misstatement if found to be within the defined materiality threshold of 5%. JetBlue’s assertion was tested according to a risk -based 
approach and the review of controls to manage these risks, including: 
 Management system and procedural review for data accuracy, reliability and reproducibility; 
 Verification of repres entative sources and processes, including audit of a sample of original source activity records of jet fuel and 
energy consumption representative of JetBlue’s operations; 
 Quantification testing and re-calculation assessments; and, 
 Interview s with corporate personnel and designated representatives . 
Certain Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions sources (energy for heating and cooling of ground facilities , fugitive emissions from ground facility 
refrigerant use) are excluded from the verification , due to the minor contribution of the sources to JetBlue’s total GHG emissions and concerns 
regarding the accuracy of the activity data . 
Conclusions 
JetBlue reported the following specific sustainability performance data totals for the 2019 calendar year: 
SUSTAINABILITY DATA INDICATOR REPORTED TOTAL 
Scope 1 GHG emissions 8,730,756 t onnes CO2e 
Scope 2 GHG emissions 25,944 tonnes CO2e 
Based on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that JetBlue’s GHG emissions assertion: 
— is not materially correct; and 
— is not a fair representation of GHG data and inf ormation; and 
— has not been prepared in accordance with The Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol . 
Recommendations 
As part of the assurance engagement, iCompli Sustainability has provided JetBlue with a series of recommendations to ensure the cont inual 
improvement of the collection, storage, analysis, and reporting of specific sustainability performance data at the corporate and facility level.

www.bpaww.com Independent Third Party Assurance Statement 
To the Board and stakeholders of JetBlue Airways Corporation: 
iCompli Sustainability , a division of BPA Worldwide , was commissioned by JetBlue Airways Corporation (JetBlue) to provide independent 
assurance of specific sustainability performance data from its business activities during the period January 1 , 2019, to December 31, 2019. 
Scope 
The organizational boundary of the verification was JetBlue’s global aircraft fleet and ground facilities, as defined using the financial control 
approach. Emissions sources include jet, diesel and gasoline fuel, and electricity consumption, to verify the following specific sustainability 
performance data: 
 Scope 1 GHG emissions 
 Scope 2 GHG emissions 
Standards & Objectives 
Our assurance was managed in accordance with ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases – Specification with guidance for the validation and 
verification of greenhouse gas assertions . The objective was to provide JetBlue stakeholders with an independent ‘limited ’ level assurance 
opinion on whether : 
 The specific s ustainability performance data within JetBlue report s adheres to the ISO 14064-3 p rinciples of relevance, completeness, 
consistency, accuracy, and transparency . 
 The specific sustainability performance data within JetBlue reports are reported according to the requirements of The Climate 
Registry General Reporting Protocol (January 2016). 
Approach and Limitations 
iCompli Sustainability conducted the verification in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14064- 3: Greenhouse gases – Specification with 
guidanc e for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions . iCompli Sustainability reviewed JetBlue’s corporate “240420 JetBlue 
Footprint Calculation 2019 REISSUED (GROUND FUEL UPDATE) ” (dated April 24 , 2020) and evaluated the data for conformity with the 
requirements o f The Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol . JetBlue’s reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions were considered free 
of material misstatement if found to be within the defined materiality threshold of 5%. JetBlue’s assertion was tested according to a risk -based 
approach and the review of controls to manage these risks, including: 
 Management system and procedural review for data accuracy, reliability and reproducibility; 
 Verification of repres entative sources and processes, including audit of a sample of original source activity records of jet fuel and 
energy consumption representative of JetBlue’s operations; 
 Quantification testing and re-calculation assessments; and, 
 Interview s with corporate personnel and designated representatives . 
Certain Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions sources (energy for heating and cooling of ground facilities , fugitive emissions from ground facility 
refrigerant use) are excluded from the verification , due to the minor contribution of the sources to JetBlue’s total GHG emissions and concerns 
regarding the accuracy of the activity data . 
Conclusions 
JetBlue reported the following specific sustainability performance data totals for the 2019 calendar year: 
SUSTAINABILITY DATA INDICATOR REPORTED TOTAL 
Scope 1 GHG emissions 8,730,756 t onnes CO2e 
Scope 2 GHG emissions 25,944 tonnes CO2e 
Based on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that JetBlue’s GHG emissions assertion: 
— is not materially correct; and 
— is not a fair representation of GHG data and inf ormation; and 
— has not been prepared in accordance with The Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol . 
Recommendations 
As part of the assurance engagement, iCompli Sustainability has provided JetBlue with a series of recommendations to ensure the cont inual 
improvement of the collection, storage, analysis, and reporting of specific sustainability performance data at the corporate and facility level.

Scope 1
We determined that our Scope 1 carbon emissions are 
not significant (Scope 1 = 0 emissions), as we do not 
own manufacturing facilities, equipment, vehicles or 
buildings that directly generate carbon emissions. 
Scope 2
We believe that the Scope 2 carbon emissions  
of our operations are significant and important to 
measure, capture and report. Our Scope 2 carbon 
emissions come from three major areas: our production 
homes, our model homes and our Design Studios  
and offices. 
One of the key challenges in measuring our Scope 2 
carbon emissions is that our business spans the country, 
and regional variables significantly affect the accuracy 
of these estimates. For example, while our corporate 
headquarters and many of our communities are located 
in California, which derives much of its electricity from 
relatively low carbon-intensive energy sources, we 
also operate in several other states, some of which rely 
on coal-based energy. In addition, the winter energy 
consumption of our premises in Colorado are far 
different than those in California or Florida.  
To help address the above challenge, the Scope 2 
carbon emissions measurement system we have 
been utilizing for over a decade to estimate our 
greenhouse gas  emissions is based on a broad sample 
that reflects specific monthly energy consumption 
tracking from multiple premises in each of our divisions 
company wide and takes into account regional 
variations in energy source and consumption. See 
page 18 of our 2009 Sustainability Report for a flow 
chart with a detailed overview of our data capture 
system and how we translate that consumption 
data into a greenhouse gas emissions estimate.2019 Scope 2

The Environmental Performance Overview 
table in the following pages shows carbon 
footprint data for the past 11 years.
Scope 3
We believe our Scope 3 carbon emissions represent 
the largest from our business operations and products. 
However, many of the impacts derived from our 
supply chain are currently beyond our capabilities to 
reasonably measure. In addition, we are not able to 
directly measure the Scope 3 carbon emissions of our 
production homes after delivery to buyers because 
we do not have direct access to our customers’ 
utility usage.  Therefore, we utilize the U.S. EPA’s 
estimates for greenhouse gas emissions associated 
with day-to-day living in ENERGY STAR certified 
homes compared to those built to current standard 
codes in order to provide reasonable estimates of 
these Scope 3 carbon emissions.  As we build only 
ENERGY STAR certified homes and the extended life 
of these homes means that they will produce emissions 
over a long timeframe, we believe this approach 
produces a particularly salient metric to evaluating 
impact and for shaping our longstanding focus on 
enhancing the resource efficiency of our homes.In 2007, we evaluated the carbon footprint of our business operations and products to inform our ongoing 
assessment of where we can make the highest possible positive impact. We then refined our methodology in 
2009 to enhance its relevance and actionability and have continued to capture this data and publicly report  
on it in the normal course of our business.

Scope 1
We determined that our Scope 1 carbon emissions are 
not significant (Scope 1 = 0 emissions), as we do not 
own manufacturing facilities, equipment, vehicles or 
buildings that directly generate carbon emissions. 
Scope 2
We believe that the Scope 2 carbon emissions  
of our operations are significant and important to 
measure, capture and report. Our Scope 2 carbon 
emissions come from three major areas: our production 
homes, our model homes and our Design Studios  
and offices. 
One of the key challenges in measuring our Scope 2 
carbon emissions is that our business spans the country, 
and regional variables significantly affect the accuracy 
of these estimates. For example, while our corporate 
headquarters and many of our communities are located 
in California, which derives much of its electricity from 
relatively low carbon-intensive energy sources, we 
also operate in several other states, some of which rely 
on coal-based energy. In addition, the winter energy 
consumption of our premises in Colorado are far 
different than those in California or Florida.  
To help address the above challenge, the Scope 2 
carbon emissions measurement system we have 
been utilizing for over a decade to estimate our 
greenhouse gas  emissions is based on a broad sample 
that reflects specific monthly energy consumption 
tracking from multiple premises in each of our divisions 
company wide and takes into account regional 
variations in energy source and consumption. See 
page 18 of our 2009 Sustainability Report for a flow 
chart with a detailed overview of our data capture 
system and how we translate that consumption 
data into a greenhouse gas emissions estimate.2019 Scope 2

The Environmental Performance Overview 
table in the following pages shows carbon

Scope 3
We believe our Scope 3 carbon emissions represent 
the largest from our business operations and products. 
However, many of the impacts derived from our 
supply chain are currently beyond our capabilities to 
reasonably measure. In addition, we are not able to 
directly measure the Scope 3 carbon emissions of our 
production homes after delivery to buyers because 
we do not have direct access to our customers’ 
utility usage.  Therefore, we utilize the U.S. EPA’s 
estimates for greenhouse gas emissions associated 
with day-to-day living in ENERGY STAR certified 
homes compared to those built to current standard 
codes in order to provide reasonable estimates of 
these Scope 3 carbon emissions.  As we build only 
ENERGY STAR certified homes and the extended life 
of these homes means that they will produce emissions 
over a long timeframe, we believe this approach 
produces a particularly salient metric to evaluating 
impact and for shaping our longstanding focus on 
enhancing the resource efficiency of our homes.In 2007, we evaluated the carbon footprint of our business operations and products to inform our ongoing 
assessment of where we can make the highest possible positive impact. We then refined our methodology in 
2009 to enhance its relevance and actionability and have continued to capture this data and publicly report  
on it in the normal course of our business.

2 E cuador offices emissions consist of emissions from the Quito and Los Encuentros offices, the Las Peñas Camp, and our FDN nursery.
3 In tensity is calculated based on FDN Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions only.
4 Base line Scope 1 and 2 recalculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol mainly due to an improvement in the accuracy of the emissions 
factor for national electric power generation in Ecuador. Previously baseline reported: 2021 Scope 1: 25,399 tCO2 e; 2021 Scope 2: 24,170 
tCO2e.

Note: Figures are roundedA more detailed account of our emissions and energy usage trends can be found in 
our 2023 Climate Change Report
�▪▪  Impr oved Reporting of Scope 3 Emissions: Lundin Gold also conducted a 
detailed review of its 2021 reporting of Scope 3 emissions and made a number 
of significant changes due to changes in methodology, corrections to certain misclassifications and recalculations due to errors. To allow for consistency in reporting going forward, Lundin Gold has re-estimated its previously reported 2021 Scope 3 emissions as set out in the table below

companies; for more information, see page 
135. No acquisitions were made in 2021.
We also work with various types of 
partnerships, e.g., with universities and other companies, which are an important part of the strategy to strengthen our local 
presence and drive innovation.
 
Net zero emissions by 2030
In 2021, we fully integrated sustainabil -
ity in the business strategy. We begun the work to measure the climate impact of our entire value chain and have set a target to reach net zero emissions from our operations by 2030. We will achieve the 
target by reducing direct emissions in our 
operations and production facilities and by contributing to the development of renewa -
ble electricity sources in our markets.
In 2018, we signed the CDP (formerly 
Carbon Disclosure Project) and we have since 2019 reported our progress on 
reducing climate impacts. After Munters 
received a D- rating in 2019, we focused 
on developing new strategies and initia -
tives on improving our carbon footprint and 
improved the rating to a C in 2020. 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 are reported in 
accordance with the GHG (Greenhouse 
Gas) Protocol.  According to the recom -
mendation, the organizational bound -
aries have been identified and set to the 
following:
	■Scope 1 and 2 include emissions from factory operations and company vehicles. Numbers exclude emissions from offices and other non-production locations, which Munters will start to measure in 2022. 
	■Scope 3 includes emissions from landfill waste generated in factory operations and from air travel. Work was initiated 
in 2021 to be able to measure relevant 
emissions from additional upstream and downstream activities in the next few years.
EU TaxonomyMunters is subject to the Taxonomy Directive adopted by the EU in June 2021. 
The purpose of the taxonomy is to help 
investors identify and compare sustainable investments through a harmonized classi -
fication system for sustainable activities. The Taxonomy is a tool to reach the EU’s 
climate targets and the goals of the EU’s 
Green Deal.
An internal project in 2021 identified 
how large a percentage of Munters’ net sales, operating expenses and investments 
is affected by the taxonomy. This work 
will continue in 2022 and is affected by new definitions and amendments that the EU periodically adds to the classification 
system. CDP rating
C
Munters joined the CDP in 2018 and since 2019 has  
reported its activities to reduce climate impacts. In 2020, 
Munters received a C rating. The goal is to improve the rating 
and despite the fact that the CDP result in 2021 also became 
C, a higher rating was achieved in almost all sub-areas, ie CDP 
2021 meant a stronger C compared to the previous year.

 Climate impact according to the GHG Protocol
Scope 1 emission increased in absolute terms as a function of 
increased production level and increased number of vehicles 
used in Services and Sales, driven by growth.
Scope 2 indirect emissions decreased with increased use of 
renewable electricity and improved energy efficiency.
Scope 1 and 2 market based emissions decreased relative to 
production value.
Scope 3 emissions increased as a result of higher production 
volume generating more waste. However, air travel decreased 
even further from the low level in 2020 when COVID drasti -
cally reduced business travel.

＊ 1  Total CO 2 emissions: Calculated based on the ""Greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting manual.” The emission factor is based on the national emission factor by country 
published by the International Energy Agency.
＊ 2 NO X (nitrogen oxides) and SO X (sulfur oxides): Total amount of NO X and SO X generated from specified facilities under the Air Pollution Control Act.
＊ 3  BOD load: Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is one of the indicators of water pollution and represents the amount of oxygen used by microorganisms to decompose pollutant 
organic material in water. The figure for BOD load was obtained by multiplying the BOD measurement by the amount of effluent to rivers.Raw Materials

challenge that threatens our viewers and their communities, our employees and partners, and society. It is not a vague or distant threat; its effects can be seen and felt today, in the form of more extreme weather, disruption of vital ecosystems, growing risks to food and water supplies, and more. We recognize this crisis is the result of human activity and that we must all change how we do things to protect current and future generations. 
Our industry is not a major 
emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change is not a discrete issue in our materiality assessment. However, both the systemic importance of climate change and its relationship to a host of other issues make it a key part of our ESG strategy. At the same time, our industry’s role in contributing to GHG emissions is evolving as media companies are growing in the streaming space – like we are, with the launch of Paramount+ in early 2021 – and we have a responsibility to measure and make public the environmental impacts of these activities. 
Across our business, we are 
implementing several strategies and initiatives to better understand and mitigate our impacts, with the ambition to work toward net-zero emissions. We are also using our content platforms to raise awareness and promote necessary action at a global scale.

challenge that threatens our viewers and their communities, our employees and partners, and society. It is not a vague or distant threat; its effects can be seen and felt today, in the form of more extreme weather, disruption of vital ecosystems, growing risks to food and water supplies, and more. We recognize this crisis is the result of human activity and that we must all change how we do things to protect current and future generations. 
Our industry is not a major 
emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change is not a discrete issue in our materiality assessment. However, both the systemic importance of climate change and its relationship to a host of other issues make it a key part of our ESG strategy. At the same time, our industry’s role in contributing to GHG emissions is evolving as media companies are growing in the streaming space – like we are, with the launch of Paramount+ in early 2021 – and we have a responsibility to measure and make public the environmental impacts of these activities. 
Across our business, we are 
implementing several strategies and initiatives to better understand and mitigate our impacts, with the ambition to work toward net-zero emissions. We are also using our content platforms to raise awareness and promote necessary action at a global scale.

It is not a vague or distant threat; its effects can be seen and felt today, in the form of more extreme weather, disruption of vital ecosystems, growing risks to food and water supplies, and more. We recognize this crisis is the result of human activity and that we must all change how we do things to protect current and future generations. 
Our industry is not a major 
emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change is not a discrete issue in our materiality assessment. However, both the systemic importance of climate change and its relationship to a host of other issues make it a key part of our ESG strategy. At the same time, our industry’s role in contributing to GHG emissions is evolving as media companies are growing in the streaming space – like we are, with the launch of Paramount+ in early 2021 – and we have a responsibility to measure and make public the environmental impacts of these activities. 
Across our business, we are 
implementing several strategies and initiatives to better understand and mitigate our impacts, with the ambition to work toward net-zero emissions. We are also using our content platforms to raise awareness and promote necessary action at a global scale.

challenge that threatens our viewers and their communities, our employees and partners, and society. It is not a vague or distant threat; its effects can be seen and felt today, in the form of more extreme weather, disruption of vital ecosystems, growing risks to food and water supplies, and more. We recognize this crisis is the result of human activity and that we must all change how we do things to protect current and future generations. 
Our industry is not a major 
emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change is not a discrete issue in our materiality assessment. However, both the systemic importance of climate change and its relationship to a host of other issues make it a key part of our ESG strategy. At the same time, our industry’s role in contributing to GHG emissions is evolving as media companies are growing in the streaming space – like we are, with the launch of Paramount+ in early 2021 – and we have a responsibility to measure and make public the environmental impacts of these activities. 
Across our business, we are 
implementing several strategies and initiatives to better understand and mitigate our impacts, with the ambition to work toward net-zero emissions. We are also using our content platforms to raise awareness and promote necessary action at a global scale.

generation, including fuel used by production vehicles and generators
Scope 2: Electricity and steam for all global sites, including estimates for locations without 
energy data and production electricity usage in leased spaces. Market-based emissions take our renewable energy contracts and utility-specific emission factors into account
Scope 3: Purchased goods and services, capital goods, streaming fuel-and-energy-related 
activities, upstream transportation, waste, business travel, and downstream transportation

Nordea Sustainability Report 2017Sustainability notes
Second, we ensure that energy used in our buildings is 
renewable. Since 2011, we have purchased 100% renewable electricity through Guarantees of Origin equal to our electricity consumption in the Nordic region, extending the commitment over the years to include our operations in Poland and Russia too. CO2e emissions from electricity in the table below is our net emissions, i.e. after buying Guarantees of Origin. We do have a challenge in terms of achieving signiﬁ  cant energy 
reductions in our larger Nordic offi   ces. They are built to state-
of-the-art construction standards and based on stringent envi-ronmental requirements set by Nordea as long-term leasehold-ers. Many of our Nordic premises are already LEED certiﬁ  ed. 
Third, for the remaining unavoidable emissions in 2017 we 
continued with the off  setting activities we have carried out 
since 2015. The combination of measures ensures that Nordea has a programme for being CarbonNeutral® certiﬁ  ed in line 
with The CarbonNeutral Protocol.

All electricity ﬁ  gures for 2016 in the climate impact table above 
have been restated due to the availability of more accurate electricity data directly from our electricity portfolio manager. We have also been able to include previously unavailable heat-ing and cooling data for headquarter buildings in Sweden. We estimate that the data covers approximately 90% of Nordea’s total energy consumption and CO2e emissions.
We report energy consumption in MWh instead of in GJ 
as required by GRI G4 regarding EN3. All electricity is renew-able. Heating and district cooling is a mix of renewable and non-renewable. 
Energy consumption data covers Denmark, Finland, Nor-
way, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. The Baltic data only covers the ﬁ  rst and second quarters of  
2017 as these were subsumed into Luminor Bank during the latter half of 2017. In 2016, data from international offi   ces 
were included but we have not been able to compile that data this year. 
Energy intensity (EN5) is calculated as total energy con-
sumption in relation to total operating income for the Nordea Group.
We report scope 1–3 emissions according to GHG Protocol. 
Our scope 1 emissions stem from diesel generators for busi-ness continuity which must be tested on a regular basis to ensure they will function in the event of an emergency out-age. The conversion calculation is based on the latest DEFRA emissions factors.
For 2017, CO2e emissions from business travel include air 
travel for our operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden and rail travel for our operations in Sweden while the ﬁ gure for 2016 included all countries of operation and air trav-
el, rail travel and car travel. Hence, comparison between the years shall be made with caution. The reason for the change 
of scope for 2017 is due to limitations in the data collection process. 
Greenhouse gas emission intensity (EN18) is calculated as 
total CO2e emissions in relation to total operating income for the Nordea Group. 
We recognise we still have certain challenges related to 
reporting our climate impact. While collecting data from our larger offi   ces is a fairly straightforward process, data from our 
branch network can be far more complex as we lease spaces within larger buildings and therefore our energy usage is often combined with that of other companies. This is a situa-tion we acknowledge but one which is diffi   cult for us to fully 
remedy due to the nature of our branch network set-up.
S4. Suppliers
Nordea has approximately 19,000 suppliers in total. 52% of them are suppliers with which we interacted multiple times in 2017. 48% of them are suppliers we interacted with only once in 2017. 
The number of contracted suppliers in our supply chain 
changed from 700 in 2016 to 1,200 for 2017. The explanation for this is that we worked to consolidate our contract data in Nordea in 2017, providing us with a more comprehensive number of our contracts.
The percentage of new contracted suppliers that were 
screened for sustainability issues is calculated based on the 165 new suppliers that were registered in our systems in 2017.
The indicators EN33, LA15, HR11 and SO10 are not reported 
as required by GRI G4. First, we don't disclose what type of sustainability impact we have identiﬁ  ed in our supply chain.

Second, we ensure that energy used in our buildings is 
renewable. Since 2011, we have purchased 100% renewable electricity through Guarantees of Origin equal to our electricity consumption in the Nordic region, extending the commitment over the years to include our operations in Poland and Russia too. CO2e emissions from electricity in the table below is our net emissions, i.e. after buying Guarantees of Origin. We do have a challenge in terms of achieving signiﬁ  cant energy 
reductions in our larger Nordic offi   ces. They are built to state-
of-the-art construction standards and based on stringent envi-ronmental requirements set by Nordea as long-term leasehold-ers. Many of our Nordic premises are already LEED certiﬁ  ed. 
Third, for the remaining unavoidable emissions in 2017 we 
continued with the off  setting activities we have carried out 
since 2015. The combination of measures ensures that Nordea has a programme for being CarbonNeutral® certiﬁ  ed in line 
with The CarbonNeutral Protocol.

All electricity ﬁ  gures for 2016 in the climate impact table above 
have been restated due to the availability of more accurate electricity data directly from our electricity portfolio manager. We have also been able to include previously unavailable heat-ing and cooling data for headquarter buildings in Sweden. We estimate that the data covers approximately 90% of Nordea’s total energy consumption and CO2e emissions.
We report energy consumption in MWh instead of in GJ 
as required by GRI G4 regarding EN3. All electricity is renew-able. Heating and district cooling is a mix of renewable and non-renewable. 
Energy consumption data covers Denmark, Finland, Nor-
way, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Russia. The Baltic data only covers the ﬁ  rst and second quarters of  
2017 as these were subsumed into Luminor Bank during the latter half of 2017. In 2016, data from international offi   ces 
were included but we have not been able to compile that data this year. 
Energy intensity (EN5) is calculated as total energy con-
sumption in relation to total operating income for the Nordea Group.
We report scope 1–3 emissions according to GHG Protocol. 
Our scope 1 emissions stem from diesel generators for busi-ness continuity which must be tested on a regular basis to ensure they will function in the event of an emergency out-age. The conversion calculation is based on the latest DEFRA emissions factors.
For 2017, CO2e emissions from business travel include air 
travel for our operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden and rail travel for our operations in Sweden while the ﬁ gure for 2016 included all countries of operation and air trav-
el, rail travel and car travel. Hence, comparison between the years shall be made with caution. The reason for the change 
of scope for 2017 is due to limitations in the data collection process. 
Greenhouse gas emission intensity (EN18) is calculated as 
total CO2e emissions in relation to total operating income for the Nordea Group. 
We recognise we still have certain challenges related to 
reporting our climate impact. While collecting data from our larger offi   ces is a fairly straightforward process, data from our 
branch network can be far more complex as we lease spaces within larger buildings and therefore our energy usage is often combined with that of other companies. This is a situa-tion we acknowledge but one which is diffi   cult for us to fully 
remedy due to the nature of our branch network set-up.
S4. Suppliers
Nordea has approximately 19,000 suppliers in total. 52% of them are suppliers with which we interacted multiple times in 2017. 48% of them are suppliers we interacted with only once in 2017. 
The number of contracted suppliers in our supply chain 
changed from 700 in 2016 to 1,200 for 2017. The explanation for this is that we worked to consolidate our contract data in Nordea in 2017, providing us with a more comprehensive number of our contracts.
The percentage of new contracted suppliers that were 
screened for sustainability issues is calculated based on the 165 new suppliers that were registered in our systems in 2017.
The indicators EN33, LA15, HR11 and SO10 are not reported 
as required by GRI G4. First, we don't disclose what type of sustainability impact we have identiﬁ  ed in our supply chain.

for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 
2) Resulting from measures of the EE project of Salzgi tter Flachstahl GmbH, affecting Scope 1 and Scope 2. 
 
The reduction in Scope 2 emissions in the current reporting year by comparis on with the previous year is due 
both to lower volumes of external power procured (see also IV “Environment” 2 “Resource Management”) and 
to the lower average carbon dioxide em ission factor in the German electr icity mix. The higher Scope 3 emis-
sions in 2018 result from increased use of lime at SZFG as well as higher emissions from pellet production at 
the relevant suppliers. 
The greatest challenge for the Group in connection with emissions affect ing the climate is the fact that CO 2 
emissions based on technologies deve lopment largely today on an intern ational scale and in the Salzgitter 
Group have nearly reached their minimum possible level within the process boundari es set by laws of na-
ture. There are therefore strict limits to future redu ctions in greenhouse gas emissions achievable merely 
through efficiency measures. SZAG therefore set up a project named SALCOS® (Salzgitter Low Carbon 
Steelmaking) in 2015 together with the Fraunhofer Gesells chaft. The aim is to examine and pursue a gradual 
transformation from today’s carbon-based to hydrogen- and electricity-based steel production. The measures derived from the project are intended to be  implemented in the Salzgi tter steel works for the 
successive, stepwise conver sion of production.  
In order to achieve a significant degree of decarbonizatio n in its primary steelmaking, SZAG wants to exploit a 
unique feature of iron metallurgy: Hydrogen can replace ca rbon in the reduction of iron ore, which leads to the 
formation of water (H
2O) instead of carbon dioxide (CO 2). The process heat required  in steelmaking and further 
processing can also be provided by electrical energy instead of carbon-based sources. This means that ulti-
mately nearly all CO 2 emissions caused by steel production can be avoided. 
To make a clear distinction between our new ideas and the concepts of CO 2 usage (Carbon Capture and Usage, CCU) 
or storage (Carbon Capture and Storage, CCS), we coined the expression “Carbon Direct Avoidance” (CDA) in No-vember 2016. The purpose of this neutral acronym is to show that our approach to the problem is not restricted to SZAG, but is technically appl icable in principle at all integrated st eelmaking facilities around the world. 
In the course of the project, the preconditions and impact of the proposed im plementation steps on our 
Group’s integrated steel mill in Salzgitter will be examin ed. Scientific support comes from the neutral expertise 
of “Fraunhofer Gesellschaft”, one of the leading rese arch organizations for a pplied science in Europe. 
If SALCOS
® is implemented, all technical me asures required for this technolo gy are to be realized at the 
Salzgitter facility in order to safeguard our company’s ex isting production plants and jobs as far as possible 
and prevent any carbon leakag e to areas outside the ETS. 
The project is based on a modular co ncept offering the possibility of gr adual implementation. The steps in-
volved can adapt to future challenging CO 2 reduction targets in Europe afte r 2030. Energy-efficient steelmaking 
at the integrated steel mill in Salzgitte r currently in existence has to be exte nsively modified on the basis of the

1) Without reducing agents; specific emission factors based on suppl ier information or common available sources. Survey is orient ed to Corporate 
Value Chain Standard (Scope 3) of the Green house Gas Protocol Initiative of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World B usiness Council 
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 
2) Resulting from measures of the EE project of Salzgi tter Flachstahl GmbH, affecting Scope 1 and Scope 2. 
 
The reduction in Scope 2 emissions in the current reporting year by comparis on with the previous year is due 
both to lower volumes of external power procured (see also IV “Environment” 2 “Resource Management”) and 
to the lower average carbon dioxide em ission factor in the German electr icity mix. The higher Scope 3 emis-
sions in 2018 result from increased use of lime at SZFG as well as higher emissions from pellet production at 
the relevant suppliers. 
The greatest challenge for the Group in connection with emissions affect ing the climate is the fact that CO 2 
emissions based on technologies deve lopment largely today on an intern ational scale and in the Salzgitter 
Group have nearly reached their minimum possible level within the process boundari es set by laws of na-
ture. There are therefore strict limits to future redu ctions in greenhouse gas emissions achievable merely 
through efficiency measures. SZAG therefore set up a project named SALCOS® (Salzgitter Low Carbon 
Steelmaking) in 2015 together with the Fraunhofer Gesells chaft. The aim is to examine and pursue a gradual 
transformation from today’s carbon-based to hydrogen- and electricity-based steel production. The measures derived from the project are intended to be  implemented in the Salzgi tter steel works for the 
successive, stepwise conver sion of production.  
In order to achieve a significant degree of decarbonizatio n in its primary steelmaking, SZAG wants to exploit a 
unique feature of iron metallurgy: Hydrogen can replace ca rbon in the reduction of iron ore, which leads to the 
formation of water (H
2O) instead of carbon dioxide (CO 2). The process heat required  in steelmaking and further 
processing can also be provided by electrical energy instead of carbon-based sources. This means that ulti-
mately nearly all CO 2 emissions caused by steel production can be avoided. 
To make a clear distinction between our new ideas and the concepts of CO 2 usage (Carbon Capture and Usage, CCU) 
or storage (Carbon Capture and Storage, CCS), we coined the expression “Carbon Direct Avoidance” (CDA) in No-vember 2016. The purpose of this neutral acronym is to show that our approach to the problem is not restricted to SZAG, but is technically appl icable in principle at all integrated st eelmaking facilities around the world. 
In the course of the project, the preconditions and impact of the proposed im plementation steps on our 
Group’s integrated steel mill in Salzgitter will be examin ed. Scientific support comes from the neutral expertise 
of “Fraunhofer Gesellschaft”, one of the leading rese arch organizations for a pplied science in Europe. 
If SALCOS
® is implemented, all technical me asures required for this technolo gy are to be realized at the 
Salzgitter facility in order to safeguard our company’s ex isting production plants and jobs as far as possible 
and prevent any carbon leakag e to areas outside the ETS. 
The project is based on a modular co ncept offering the possibility of gr adual implementation. The steps in-
volved can adapt to future challenging CO 2 reduction targets in Europe afte r 2030. Energy-efficient steelmaking 
at the integrated steel mill in Salzgitte r currently in existence has to be exte nsively modified on the basis of the

*  In line with the GHG Protocol standard, a location-based emission figure has been reported for electricity consumption. The market-based figure is used in combined emission figures. The location-based figure refers to figures calculated using country-specific emission coefficients and figures 
calculated using electricity-supplier-specific, market-based emission coefficients. If the emission coefficients given for the calculation year were not available for the previous year’s calculation, this data was recalculated for this report using the emission coefficient data given for the year in 
question. Due to a possible recalculation, the emissions data reported for the preceding year may deviate from the data reporting in the previous emissions report. Electricity does not produce any emissions because it is produced 100% by nuclear power.

*  In line with the GHG Protocol standard, a location-based emission figure has been reported for electricity consumption. The market-based figure is used in combined emission figures. The location-based figure refers to figures calculated using country-specific emission coefficients and figures 
calculated using electricity-supplier-specific, market-based emission coefficients. If the emission coefficients given for the calculation year were not available for the previous year’s calculation, this data was recalculated for this report using the emission coefficient data given for the year in 
question. Due to a possible recalculation, the emissions data reported for the preceding year may deviate from the data reporting in the previous emissions report. Electricity does not produce any emissions because it is produced 100% by nuclear power.

*  In line with the GHG Protocol standard, a location-based emission figure has been reported for electricity consumption. The market-based figure is used in combined emission figures. The location-based figure refers to figures calculated using country-specific emission coefficients and figures 
calculated using electricity-supplier-specific, market-based emission coefficients. If the emission coefficients given for the calculation year were not available for the previous year’s calculation, this data was recalculated for this report using the emission coefficient data given for the year in 
question. Due to a possible recalculation, the emissions data reported for the preceding year may deviate from the data reporting in the previous emissions report. Electricity does not produce any emissions because it is produced 100% by nuclear power.
** Emissions from residents’ wasteThe following SATO envi-
ronmental sustainability in-
dicators have been assured 
by an independent third 
party. See Sustainability 
concepts for more informa-
tion about key figures and 
definitions of concepts.

we report natural gas usage between Scope 1 and 2. Previously, in Scope 1, we reported natural gas for 
owned offices as well as landlord- controlled offices where we paid the utility bills directly . In Scope 2,  we 
reported landlord- controlled offices where we were billed the energy usage through the landlord.  However, 
the landlord- controlled invoice payment c ould change year-to-year, producing arbitrary variability in 
whether the same natural gas usage fell to Scope 1 versus Scope 2. This year, we began reporting only

• In 2019, in order to provide better year -over-year consistency, Stantec made a slight modification to how 
we report natural gas usage between Scope 1 and 2. Previously, in Scope 1, we reported natural gas for 
owned offices as well as landlord- controlled offices where we paid the utility bills directly . In Scope 2,  we 
reported landlord- controlled offices where we were billed the energy usage through the landlord.  However, 
the landlord- controlled invoice payment c ould change year-to-year, producing arbitrary variability in 
whether the same natural gas usage fell to Scope 1 versus Scope 2. This year, we began reporting only 
owned office natural gas usage in Scope 1 (there is only one owned office that uses natural gas) and all landlord- controlled natural gas usage in Scope 2.

Climate ChangeGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
For all relevant greenhouse gases (e.g. carbon dioxide, methane, 
nitrous oxide, F -gases etc.), report in metric tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) GHG Protocol Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions.
Estimate and report material upstream and downstream (GHG Protocol Scope 3) emissions where appropriate.Sumitomo Corporation Group’s greenhouse gas emissions (t-CO2e) for FY2020 are as follows:
• Scope 1: 1,526,724
(Breakdown of GHG type) 
CO2  1,522,514
N2O         4,210
• Scope 2: 652,611
• Scope 3 Upstream Transportation and Distribution: 3,875
• Scope 3 Waste: 5
• Scope 3 Business Trips: 67
• Scope 3 Employee Commuting: 140• Scope 3 Downstream Leased Assets : 30,294
For more information such as the reporting boundaries and CO2 emissions, see our Environmental Data available on page 120.Also, please refer to page 39 for our CO2 emission reduction initiatives that we announced as the mid -term goal for climate chan ge 
mitigation. 
TCFD implementation
Fully implement the recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). If necessary, 
disclose a timeline of at most three years for full implementation. 
Disclose whether you have set, or have committed to set, GHG 
emissions targets that are in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement –to limit global warming to well below 2 °C above pre-
industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 °C –and 
to achieve net -zero emissions before 2050.Sumitomo Corporation has been supporting the TCFD recommendations since March 2019. Please see page 25 to 39  for the disclos ure
on governance, strategy, risk management, targets and KPIs related to climate change based on the TCFD recommendations. 
Also, we have identified ""mitigation of climate change"" as one of the 6 key social issues which the Group will address to ach ieve a 
sustainable society. As a long-term goal, the Group will aim to carbon neutralize its business by 2050, and also will aim to ach ieve its mid-
term goal, which is to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% or more by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. 
Paris -aligned GHG emissions targets
Define and report progress against time-bound science -based 
GHG emissions targets that are in line with the goals of the Paris 
Agreement –to limit global warming to well below 2 °C above 
pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 °C. 
This should include defining a date before 2050 by which you will achieve net -zero greenhouse gas emissions, and interim reduction 
targets based on the methodologies provided by the Science 
Based Targets initiative, if applicable.
If an alternative approach is taken, disclose the methodology used 
to calculate the targets and the basis on which they deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement.As stated above, we have a long-term goal of seeking to become carbon neutral in the Group's business by 2050 and we will also contribute to the carbon neutralization of society. Also, we have set a mid -term goal of reducing the CO2 emissions by 50% or more by 
2035 compared to 2019 levels.

（*1） The boundary of “Consolidated” is non -consolidated, consolidated subsidiaries and Joint operations. We have added Joint operations to the boundary from FY2020. For Joint operations, the amount equivalent to the investment ratio as of the end of March of the reporting period is included in the 
environmental data. One site of the Joint operations is excluded from the scope of FY2020 because its data collection system is not in place yet.
（*2） * CO2 emission factors for electricity: (Non-consolidated in Japan) The basic emission coefficients of individual power companies.
(Consolidated subsidiaries in Japan) The average emission coefficient of all power companies.
(Overseas) Emission factors from electricity generation are based on the country -specific data in 2013 listed on ""CO2 EMISSIONS FROM FUEL COMBUSTION 2016 EDITION"", an IEA (International Energy Agency) statistics.
* CO2 emission factors other than those from electricity generation are based on a manual for GHG emissions accounting, repor ting, and disclosure systems published by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
* Group companies emitting more than 3,000 t -CO2e for each gas per year are subject to the aggregation of Scope1<other GHGs (Non energy -related CO2 and greenhouse gases other than CO2)>, under the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Accounting, Reporting, and Disclos ure System in Japan.
In FY2018 and FY2019, we aggregated non-consolidated and consolidated subsidiaries in Japan and the scope of Scope1<other GHG s> was expanded to consolidated (excluding Joint operations) in FY2020.
* Scope1 <other GHGs> 4,210 t -CO2e in FY2020 was derived from Dinitrogen monoxide (N2O).
* The main reason for the increase of GHG emissions in FY2020 compared to FY2019 is the addition of Joint operations to the boundary of data. 
* The CO2 emissions from Joint operation in the power generation business are included in the FY2019 results, which is the ba se year of Sumitomo Corporation Group's carbon neutrality, and FY2020 results in this book -Our Climate Change Initiatives -. The sc ope of Sumitomo Corporation Group’s  
carbon neutrality includes the following 
in addition to the GHG emissions above;
Scope1,2: Direct CO2 emissions from Sumitomo Corporation's affiliated companies under the equity method for power generation businesses, as well as indirect CO2 emissions from the generation of energy used by those companies.
Scope3  : Indirect CO2 emissions associated with the use of energy resources produced by fossil energy concession of Sumitom o Corporation Group, its subsidiaries, and affiliated companies under the equity method.
Please see this book  -Our Climate Change Initiatives -for details of the Sumitomo Corporation Group carbon neutral. 
* We couldn't collect the environmental data for 38 sites due to COVID -19 lockdown or working from home in FY2019. In FY2018, GHG emissions of these sites were equivalent to about 5.2% of the total GHG emissions.
（*3） * GHG emissions from logistics include the transport of cargo within Japan for which Sumitomo Corporation is the cargo owner, and are calculated based on a manual for GHG emissions accounting, reporting, and disclosure systems published by Japan’s Minis tryof the Environment and Ministry of 
Economy, Trade and Industry. 
Sumitomo Corporation complies with the Act and reduces the use of energy of transportation through promotion of modal shift ( utilization of railroads and vessels), optimization of delivery routes and loading on vehicles, promotion of eco-driving, etc. W e have set a target of reducing the use of energy 
from logistics per shipping weight by at least 1% annually in Japan.
* GHG emissions from waste are calculated from all general waste of Sumitomo Corporation.
Up to FY2018, emissions were calculated using emission intensity for incineration treatment published by the Carbon Footprint Communication Program. The results after FY2019 were calculated using the emission intensity for each type of waste, which is published in the emission intensit y database 
for calculating greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions by organizations throughout the supply chain. The calculation of GHG emissions for FY2020 uses the emission intensity database Ver.3.1. 
* GHG emissions due to overseas business trips are the emissions from flights departing from and arriving in Japan that Sumit omo Corporation employees took. Business trip destinations are classified into 12 areas and passenger -kilometers are estimated base d on the travel distance between Japan and 
representative airport of each area. GHG emissions due to overseas business trips are calculated by applying CO2 emission fac tors published by the UK's Defra to the passenger -kilometers.
* GHG emissions from commuting are those from the commuting of Sumitomo Corporation's employees working in Japan, calculated by using the emissions factors per passenger -kilometer for passenger transport by transport mode published in the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism 
publication ""CO2 Emissions in the Transport Sector.""
* GHG emissions from downstream leased assets are those from the buildings that Sumitomo Corporation owns and leases to tenants , using by CO2 emission factors described in the Act on the Rational Use of Energy in Japan.
* GHG emissions (the above Scope1, 2 and Scope3) were 1,641,079t -CO2e ／1,537,072t -CO2e ／2,213,716t -CO2e in FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020 respectively.",5055

For Joint operations, the amount equivalent to the investment ratio as of the end of March of the reporting period is included in the 
environmental data. One site of the Joint operations is excluded from the scope of FY2020 because its data collection system is not in place yet.
（*2） * CO2 emission factors for electricity: (Non-consolidated in Japan) The basic emission coefficients of individual power companies.
(Consolidated subsidiaries in Japan) The average emission coefficient of all power companies.
(Overseas) Emission factors from electricity generation are based on the country -specific data in 2013 listed on ""CO2 EMISSIONS FROM FUEL COMBUSTION 2016 EDITION"", an IEA (International Energy Agency) statistics.
* CO2 emission factors other than those from electricity generation are based on a manual for GHG emissions accounting, repor ting, and disclosure systems published by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
* Group companies emitting more than 3,000 t -CO2e for each gas per year are subject to the aggregation of Scope1<other GHGs (Non energy -related CO2 and greenhouse gases other than CO2)>, under the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Accounting, Reporting, and Disclos ure System in Japan.
In FY2018 and FY2019, we aggregated non-consolidated and consolidated subsidiaries in Japan and the scope of Scope1<other GHG s> was expanded to consolidated (excluding Joint operations) in FY2020.
* Scope1 <other GHGs> 4,210 t -CO2e in FY2020 was derived from Dinitrogen monoxide (N2O).
* The main reason for the increase of GHG emissions in FY2020 compared to FY2019 is the addition of Joint operations to the boundary of data. 
* The CO2 emissions from Joint operation in the power generation business are included in the FY2019 results, which is the ba se year of Sumitomo Corporation Group's carbon neutrality, and FY2020 results in this book -Our Climate Change Initiatives -. The sc ope of Sumitomo Corporation Group’s  
carbon neutrality includes the following 
in addition to the GHG emissions above;
Scope1,2: Direct CO2 emissions from Sumitomo Corporation's affiliated companies under the equity method for power generation businesses, as well as indirect CO2 emissions from the generation of energy used by those companies.
Scope3  : Indirect CO2 emissions associated with the use of energy resources produced by fossil energy concession of Sumitom o Corporation Group, its subsidiaries, and affiliated companies under the equity method.
Please see this book  -Our Climate Change Initiatives -for details of the Sumitomo Corporation Group carbon neutral. 
* We couldn't collect the environmental data for 38 sites due to COVID -19 lockdown or working from home in FY2019. In FY2018, GHG emissions of these sites were equivalent to about 5.2% of the total GHG emissions.
（*3） * GHG emissions from logistics include the transport of cargo within Japan for which Sumitomo Corporation is the cargo owner, and are calculated based on a manual for GHG emissions accounting, reporting, and disclosure systems published by Japan’s Minis tryof the Environment and Ministry of 
Economy, Trade and Industry. 
Sumitomo Corporation complies with the Act and reduces the use of energy of transportation through promotion of modal shift ( utilization of railroads and vessels), optimization of delivery routes and loading on vehicles, promotion of eco-driving, etc. W e have set a target of reducing the use of energy 
from logistics per shipping weight by at least 1% annually in Japan.
* GHG emissions from waste are calculated from all general waste of Sumitomo Corporation.
Up to FY2018, emissions were calculated using emission intensity for incineration treatment published by the Carbon Footprint Communication Program. The results after FY2019 were calculated using the emission intensity for each type of waste, which is published in the emission intensit y database 
for calculating greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions by organizations throughout the supply chain. The calculation of GHG emissions for FY2020 uses the emission intensity database Ver.3.1. 
* GHG emissions due to overseas business trips are the emissions from flights departing from and arriving in Japan that Sumit omo Corporation employees took. Business trip destinations are classified into 12 areas and passenger -kilometers are estimated base d on the travel distance between Japan and 
representative airport of each area. GHG emissions due to overseas business trips are calculated by applying CO2 emission fac tors published by the UK's Defra to the passenger -kilometers.
* GHG emissions from commuting are those from the commuting of Sumitomo Corporation's employees working in Japan, calculated by using the emissions factors per passenger -kilometer for passenger transport by transport mode published in the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism 
publication ""CO2 Emissions in the Transport Sector.""
* GHG emissions from downstream leased assets are those from the buildings that Sumitomo Corporation owns and leases to tenants , using by CO2 emission factors described in the Act on the Rational Use of Energy in Japan.
* GHG emissions (the above Scope1, 2 and Scope3) were 1,641,079t -CO2e ／1,537,072t -CO2e ／2,213,716t -CO2e in FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020 respectively.",5075

for calculating greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions by organizations throughout the supply chain. The calculation of GHG emissions for FY2020 uses the emission intensity database Ver.3.1. 
* GHG emissions due to overseas business trips are the emissions from flights departing from and arriving in Japan that Sumit omo Corporation employees took. Business trip destinations are classified into 12 areas and passenger -kilometers are estimated base d on the travel distance between Japan and 
representative airport of each area. GHG emissions due to overseas business trips are calculated by applying CO2 emission fac tors published by the UK's Defra to the passenger -kilometers.
* GHG emissions from commuting are those from the commuting of Sumitomo Corporation's employees working in Japan, calculated by using the emissions factors per passenger -kilometer for passenger transport by transport mode published in the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism 
publication ""CO2 Emissions in the Transport Sector.""
* GHG emissions from downstream leased assets are those from the buildings that Sumitomo Corporation owns and leases to tenants , using by CO2 emission factors described in the Act on the Rational Use of Energy in Japan.
* GHG emissions (the above Scope1, 2 and Scope3) were 1,641,079t -CO2e ／1,537,072t -CO2e ／2,213,716t -CO2e in FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020 respectively.",5078

but also emissions generated across their entire value chain.Based on the GHG Protocol*2, which provides international standards for calculating GHG emissions, and the Ministry of the Environment’s Basic Guidelines for Calculating GHG Emissions throughout the value Chain, Toshiba Tec Group calculates indirect GHG emissions generated outside the scope of its own business activities (Scope 3) in addition to its own emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) in accordance with Toshiba Group’s Policy.Toshiba Tec Group will continue working effectively throughout product lifecycles by quantitatively analyzing emissions per category as described above.

Under our ambitious timeline, we’ll close 
about 1.5 GW of coal-fired capacity in 
 Germany by year-end 2022 and intend to 
submit another 1.4 GW to the federal  government’s shutdown scheme by 2025.  
We had already withdrawn just over 2.4 GW 
through year-end 2015. Together, these 
 closures will yield total carbon savings of  
up to 18 million metric tons per year.
Datteln 4, our new hard-coal-fired power 
plant in west-central Germany, is scheduled  Germany by 40% by the end of 2025. This is 
why, after careful consideration, the German 
federal government decided that the country could decarbonize more quickly by having Datteln 4 become operational and displace the production of older, less efficient 
 coal-fired plants.
In February 2020, we signed an agreement 
to sell our 58% stake in Schkopau, a 
 lignite-fired power plant in Saxony-Anhalt in 
eastern Germany, to Saale Energie GmbH, a subsidiary of Czech energy producer EPH, 
which owns the other 42%. The transfer of 
ownership will take place in October 2021. It will mark the end of our lignite-fired power 
generation in Europe.
Coal is still part, but now a steadily shrinking 
part, of our portfolio. Roughly two-thirds of 
our total electricity and heat output already comes from low-emission hydro, nuclear, 
and gas. As we close coal-fired plants, this 
proportion will increase and our carbon  intensity will decrease, bringing us progres -
sively closer to our goal of carbon neutrality.
Gas, the cleanest fossil fuel, has a unique 
ability to deliver deep and rapid emissions 
reductions across many sectors. Gas is the 
fastest way to decarbonize the power  industry. Shifting from coal and petroleum  products to gas will rapidly reduce  emissions 
in heavy industry, space heating, and 
 transport. Multi-sector conversion to gas is 
the fastest and cheapest way for Europe to 
 reduce its carbon emissions by up to 65% in 
the next two decades. Gas will also serve as 
a vital emissions-reducing technology today 
while transformative innovations, like  synthetic fuels, are developed and scaled up.
Natural gas can play its role in the energy 
transition even more effectively if it becomes more climate friendly, for example, when 
equipment to produce hydrogen and 
 methane is powered by renewable electricity 
in a process known as power-to-gas. 
 Alternative fuels can help make mobility 
more sustainable as well. Uniper is therefore developing businesses for several  alternative 
fuels, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) as 
a fuel for heavy trucks. LNG trucks have  lower emissions and are quieter.to enter service in the summer of 2020. 
There has been some criticism regarding the 
commissioning of Datteln 4 along with the 
decision on a coal exit in Germany. However, Datteln 4 is significantly more efficient  
than older coal-fired power plants. When 
 cogenerating heat for 100,000 households  
in the  region it will have a fuel efficiency of 
nearly 60%, similar to that of a gas turbine. 
Along with the aforementioned plant 
 closures,  having Datteln 4 online will enable 
us to  reduce our carbon emissions in

Under our ambitious timeline, we’ll close 
about 1.5 GW of coal-fired capacity in 
 Germany by year-end 2022 and intend to 
submit another 1.4 GW to the federal  government’s shutdown scheme by 2025.  
We had already withdrawn just over 2.4 GW 
through year-end 2015. Together, these 
 closures will yield total carbon savings of  
up to 18 million metric tons per year.
Datteln 4, our new hard-coal-fired power 
plant in west-central Germany, is scheduled  Germany by 40% by the end of 2025. This is 
why, after careful consideration, the German 
federal government decided that the country could decarbonize more quickly by having Datteln 4 become operational and displace the production of older, less efficient 
 coal-fired plants.
In February 2020, we signed an agreement 
to sell our 58% stake in Schkopau, a 
 lignite-fired power plant in Saxony-Anhalt in 
eastern Germany, to Saale Energie GmbH, a subsidiary of Czech energy producer EPH, 
which owns the other 42%. The transfer of 
ownership will take place in October 2021. It will mark the end of our lignite-fired power 
generation in Europe.
Coal is still part, but now a steadily shrinking 
part, of our portfolio. Roughly two-thirds of 
our total electricity and heat output already comes from low-emission hydro, nuclear, 
and gas. As we close coal-fired plants, this 
proportion will increase and our carbon  intensity will decrease, bringing us progres -
sively closer to our goal of carbon neutrality.
Gas, the cleanest fossil fuel, has a unique 
ability to deliver deep and rapid emissions 
reductions across many sectors. Gas is the 
fastest way to decarbonize the power  industry. Shifting from coal and petroleum  products to gas will rapidly reduce  emissions 
in heavy industry, space heating, and 
 transport. Multi-sector conversion to gas is 
the fastest and cheapest way for Europe to 
 reduce its carbon emissions by up to 65% in 
the next two decades. Gas will also serve as 
a vital emissions-reducing technology today 
while transformative innovations, like  synthetic fuels, are developed and scaled up.
Natural gas can play its role in the energy 
transition even more effectively if it becomes more climate friendly, for example, when 
equipment to produce hydrogen and 
 methane is powered by renewable electricity 
in a process known as power-to-gas. 
 Alternative fuels can help make mobility 
more sustainable as well. Uniper is therefore developing businesses for several  alternative 
fuels, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) as 
a fuel for heavy trucks. LNG trucks have  lower emissions and are quieter.to enter service in the summer of 2020. 
There has been some criticism regarding the 
commissioning of Datteln 4 along with the 
decision on a coal exit in Germany. However, Datteln 4 is significantly more efficient  
than older coal-fired power plants. When 
 cogenerating heat for 100,000 households  
in the  region it will have a fuel efficiency of 
nearly 60%, similar to that of a gas turbine. 
Along with the aforementioned plant 
 closures,  having Datteln 4 online will enable 
us to  reduce our carbon emissions in

A higher CDP score

naire, about Uniper’s performance in the 
2018 calendar year. CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, runs a global 
disclosure system for companies to improve 
awareness through measurement and  disclosure of environmental data, climate 
risks, and carbon management. After 
 evaluating our responses, CDP gave Uniper a 
score of B- which is an improvement on the previous year’s score (C). Scores range from 
A (best) to F. CDP raised the score because it 
recognized that we had identified and  realized potential for improvement in our sustainability performance. We will continue 
our efforts in 2020 and are evaluating 
 actions that could further improve our CDP 
score.
Climate Action & Strategy Team
 GRI 103-1 and GRI 305-5   Uniper aims to be a 
 pacesetter in decarbonizing the energy it 
 supplies. To help us play this role as

formed a panel of experts, the Climate Action &  Strategy Team. Led by the HSSE & 
 Sustainability and Corporate Strategy 
 departments, it brings together representa -
tives of other  departments that are integral 
to  setting our  decarbonization course.
The team’s first task is to carefully analyze 
Uniper’s current emission baseline by 
 geography, fuel type, and emission scope (1, 
2, and 3). The next – as part of the implemen -
tation of our new strategy – is to identify the 
various decarbonization options available to 
us in power generation and commodity  trading and assess their potential impact on 
our carbon footprint, operations, and bottom 
line. Bringing these two sets of information together – detailed emissions data and a list of decarbonization options – will enable the 
Uniper Management Board to set specific 
ambitious emission reduction targets per business that are economically viable and enable us to continue to provide a reliable supply of energy to customers.
The team’s third task is to define Uniper’s 
 future approach to emission disclosures. 
Transparency is integral to our climate strat -
egy and will guide this approach. As stated 
above, Uniper has already improved its  
CDP score, and the team will explore ways to further improve this score and trans -
parency generally. As part of this  effort,  
the team will continue to assess  whether, 
and to what degree, the framework for  
voluntary climate-related financial risk 
 disclosures issued by the Task Force on 
 Climate-related Financial Disclosures  
(TCFD) could fit with Uniper’s approach

A higher CDP score
In 2019, Uniper responded to CDP’s  sector-specific climate change question -
naire, about Uniper’s performance in the 
2018 calendar year. CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, runs a global 
disclosure system for companies to improve 
awareness through measurement and  disclosure of environmental data, climate 
risks, and carbon management. After 
 evaluating our responses, CDP gave Uniper a 
score of B- which is an improvement on the previous year’s score (C). Scores range from 
A (best) to F. CDP raised the score because it 
recognized that we had identified and  realized potential for improvement in our sustainability performance. We will continue 
our efforts in 2020 and are evaluating 
 actions that could further improve our CDP 
score.
Climate Action & Strategy Team
 GRI 103-1 and GRI 305-5   Uniper aims to be a 
 pacesetter in decarbonizing the energy it 
 supplies. To help us play this role as 
 effectively as possible, in December 2019 we 
formed a panel of experts, the Climate Action &  Strategy Team. Led by the HSSE & 
 Sustainability and Corporate Strategy 
 departments, it brings together representa -
tives of other  departments that are integral 
to  setting our  decarbonization course.
The team’s first task is to carefully analyze 
Uniper’s current emission baseline by 
 geography, fuel type, and emission scope (1, 
2, and 3). The next – as part of the implemen -
tation of our new strategy – is to identify the 
various decarbonization options available to 
us in power generation and commodity  trading and assess their potential impact on 
our carbon footprint, operations, and bottom 
line. Bringing these two sets of information together – detailed emissions data and a list of decarbonization options – will enable the 
Uniper Management Board to set specific 
ambitious emission reduction targets per business that are economically viable and enable us to continue to provide a reliable supply of energy to customers.
The team’s third task is to define Uniper’s 
 future approach to emission disclosures. 
Transparency is integral to our climate strat -
egy and will guide this approach. As stated 
above, Uniper has already improved its  
CDP score, and the team will explore ways to further improve this score and trans -
parency generally. As part of this  effort,  
the team will continue to assess  whether, 
and to what degree, the framework for  
voluntary climate-related financial risk

Waste
Generated waste includes both waste from production and administrative facilities. Only waste that we are certain can be recycled by our waste management service providers is included in recycled waste. The respective quantities were determined on the basis of invoices. Waste from sales ofﬁ  ces, 
non-production sites and sites without operational control would contribute to less than approximately 6%

in the data presented.
GHG emissions
This year, we focused on determining Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Over the course of the next year, we will advance to include Scope 3. This GHG inventory was compiled in accord-ance with the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.
In accordance with the GHG Protocol Corpo-
rate Accounting Standard, we report Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions separately. For Scope 2, we consider the marked-based approach as well as the location-based approach. 
We report on all emissions from our produc-
tion facilities worldwide. The organisational boundary applied to consolidate VARTA’s emissions was the ﬁ  nancial control approach.

The considerable  reduction  in natural  gas and LPG in 2019  is due to the sale of Lane ’s Plants  & Paving  division  
in the US as it uses  large  quantities  of these  energy  sources.  The reduction  in the consumption  of diesel,  petrol  
and electricity  is also a result  of the above  sale.  However,  the smaller  diesel  consumption  is mostly  due to the 
lesser  work  carried  out on the GERD  and Koysha projects  in Ethiopia.  The large  contraction  in subcontractors ’ 
consumption,  and related  Scope  3 GHG  emissions,  is principally  a result  of the projects  of Salini  Polska  (Poland),  
the Rogun  project  (Tajikistan)  and the opening  of the Copenhagen  Cityringen  metro  in Denmark.   
The Group ’s main  energy  rationalisation  systems  include  the use of highly  efficient  vehicles  and equipment,  
connecting  its building  site plants  to electricity  networks  rather  than diesel  generators,  carrying  out regular  
maintenance  programmes  for its vehicles,  improving  power  quality  and informing  its employees  about  the 
importance  of energy  saving.  
Significant  contributors  to the reduction  in GHG  emissions  are the projects  to connect  to the electricity  grid 
systems,  especially  when  the host country’s  energy  mix is mostly  made  up of renewable  energy.  This is the 
case  in Ethiopia,  where  the GERD  hydropower  project  work  site uses  renewable  energy  generated  by other  
hydropower  plants  already  active  in this country,  shortly  to be joined  by the Koysha  work  site, where  a power

The considerable  reduction  in natural  gas and LPG in 2019  is due to the sale of Lane ’s Plants  & Paving  division  
in the US as it uses  large  quantities  of these  energy  sources.  The reduction  in the consumption  of diesel,  petrol  
and electricity  is also a result  of the above  sale.  However,  the smaller  diesel  consumption  is mostly  due to the 
lesser  work  carried  out on the GERD  and Koysha projects  in Ethiopia.  The large  contraction  in subcontractors ’ 
consumption,  and related  Scope  3 GHG  emissions,  is principally  a result  of the projects  of Salini  Polska  (Poland),  
the Rogun  project  (Tajikistan)  and the opening  of the Copenhagen  Cityringen  metro  in Denmark.   
The Group ’s main  energy  rationalisation  systems  include  the use of highly  efficient  vehicles  and equipment,
